Demographic correlates of use and disorder evident in other populations are typically apparent among AI/ANs as well, albeit with notable variations across specific AI/AN groups. AI/AN youth, for example, tend to start substance use earlier and in patterns somewhat distinct from those of other American youth, underscoring the need for early and tailored prevention efforts in AI/AN communities. Gender has been shown to have differential associations across tribes. Some demographic risk factors have limited variability and unique patterns in AI/AN populations, making inferences difficult. For instance, poverty is prevalent in AI/AN communities, rendering attributions about risk challenging. Similar complications are related to the limited educational and employment ecologies within many AI/AN communities. As argued within the Social Determinants of Health framework, major inroads into reducing health disparities likely depend on addressing demographic disparities."}

Notably, AI/AN status correlates with elevated rates of substance-related mortality, with alcohol-related deaths, chronic liver disease, and drug-related issues being notably higher. Additionally, AI/AN adolescents exhibit earlier initiation and higher rates of substance use, particularly among those living on reservations or who have dropped out of school, while AI/AN adults who drink tend to engage in heavy, episodic drinking patterns. Correlations are also observed between AI/AN communities and substance availability, trauma exposure, family and peer networks, and historical trauma, all of which impact substance use patterns and disparities within these communities. These correlational findings emphasize the multifaceted nature of substance use issues in AI/AN populations and highlight potential areas for targeted intervention and prevention efforts."}
