SupportingText: The text provides information on the demographic characteristics of American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations, such as their population size, geographic distribution, and socioeconomic status. It also discusses the epidemiology of substance use and disorder among AI/AN populations, highlighting the variability in patterns of substance use across different tribal groups and geographic regions. However, the text does not explicitly state the relationship between demographic factors and epidemiological patterns of substance use. Therefore, the relationship between demographic and epidemiological patterns of substance use is inconclusive based on the given text.{"VariableOneName": "Demographic factors", "VariableTwoName": "Epidemiological patterns of substance use", "RelationshipClassification": "Direct", "SupportingText": "The text states that demographic factors are often markers of underlying risk processes and can be critical in identifying targets for prevention efforts.

AI/AN youth, for example, tend to start substance use earlier and in patterns somewhat distinct from those of other American youth, underscoring the need for early and tailored prevention efforts in AI/AN communities. Gender has been shown to have differential associations across tribes. Some demographic risk factors have limited variability and unique patterns in AI/AN populations, making inferences difficult. For instance, poverty is prevalent in AI/AN communities, rendering attributions about risk challenging. Similar complications are related to the limited educational and employment ecologies within many AI/AN communities. As argued within the Social Determinants of Health framework, major inroads into reducing health disparities likely depend on addressing demographic disparities."}{"VariableOneName": "Demographic Factors", "VariableTwoName": "Epidemiological patterns of substance use", "RelationshipClassification": "Direct", "SupportingText": "Demographic factors are often markers of underlying risk processes (rather than risk factors themselves), but they can be critical in identifying targets for prevention efforts.
