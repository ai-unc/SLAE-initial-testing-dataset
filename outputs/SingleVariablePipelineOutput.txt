Demographic correlates of use and disorder evident in other populations are typically apparent among AI/ANs as well, albeit with notable variations across specific AI/AN groups. AI/AN youth, for example, tend to start substance use earlier and in patterns somewhat distinct from those of other American youth, underscoring the need for early and tailored prevention efforts in AI/AN communities. Gender has been shown to have differential associations across tribes. Some demographic risk factors have limited variability and unique patterns in AI/AN populations, making inferences difficult. For instance, poverty is prevalent in AI/AN communities, rendering attributions about risk challenging. Similar complications are related to the limited educational and employment ecologies within many AI/AN communities. As argued within the Social Determinants of Health framework, major inroads into reducing health disparities likely depend on addressing demographic disparities."}
