{"Relations": [{"VariableOneName": "Forced-failure stress", "VariableTwoName": "Sadness", "SupportingText": "The present findings suggest a difference between patient categories, such that long-term stress relative to acute depression induces changes in functional brain activity, notably in areas within the frontal cortex, as well as a flattening of the diurnal cortisol curve.", "Reasoning": "The text indicates that long-term stress relative to acute depression leads to changes in functional brain activity and a flattening of the diurnal cortisol curve. This suggests a potential relationship between forced-failure stress and sadness.", "RelationshipClassification": "Direct"}]}
