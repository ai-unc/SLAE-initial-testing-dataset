We found that compared to HCs, MDD patients showed comprehensive less brain activation during both the WM maintenance and manipulation conditions. Particularly, we found decreased brain activation in the left fusiform gyrus, SMA, and APFC. The reduced activation of the left fusiform gyrus may indicate impaired emotional stimuli processing function, while the decreased activation of the SMA and APFC may suggest impaired cognitive control function.", "Reasoning": "The text does not explicitly state a relationship between cognitive distraction and rumination. However, the findings suggest that cognitive distraction, represented by decreased brain activation in the left fusiform gyrus, SMA, and APFC, may be associated with reduced rumination, as rumination is often linked to overthinking and dwelling on negative thoughts. Therefore, based on the results of decreased brain activation in regions associated with cognitive distraction, it is reasonable to infer a potential inverse relationship between cognitive distraction and rumination.", "RelationshipClassification": "Inverse"}, {"VariableOneName": "Forced-failure stress", "VariableTwoName": "Sadness", "SupportingText": "In our pilot study, the decreased brain activation of the left fusiform gyrus, SMA, and APFC helps us to understand the abnormalities of the emotional stimuli processing function, executive function, and cognitive control function in MDD.
