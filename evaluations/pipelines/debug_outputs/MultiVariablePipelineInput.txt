The review establishes several correlational relationships in the context of substance use and disorder among American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations in the United States. Notably, AI/AN status correlates with elevated rates of substance-related mortality, with alcohol-related deaths, chronic liver disease, and drug-related issues being notably higher. Additionally, AI/AN adolescents exhibit earlier initiation and higher rates of substance use, particularly among those living on reservations or who have dropped out of school, while AI/AN adults who drink tend to engage in heavy, episodic drinking patterns. Correlations are also observed between AI/AN communities and substance availability, trauma exposure, family and peer networks, and historical trauma, all of which impact substance use patterns and disparities within these communities. These correlational findings emphasize the multifaceted nature of substance use issues in AI/AN populations and highlight potential areas for targeted intervention and prevention efforts.

Given the text validate a series of relationships between variables that will be included in a json format below.
For example, if the json includes a relation like "Country's per capita income -> Country's literacy rate", and the text includes "We find a strong correlation p < .0001 between a country's per capita income and it's literacy rate" then the RelationshipClassification would be direct.
If instead the text includes ""We find a strong inverse correlation p < .0001 between a country's per capita income and it's literacy rate" then the RelationshipClassification would be inverse.
The SupportText field of your output should include verbaitum text related to the relation between the two variables without paraphrasing.
The Reasoning field should be used to step by step reason from the text of the paper to try to come up with a good relationship classification and should focus on plainly stated results over implications.
The RelationshipClassification field can only be 'direct', 'inverse', 'not applicable', or 'uncorrelated'.
Direct means that an increase in one would cause a decrease in another, and inverse means that an increase in one would cause a decrease in another.
Uncorrelated means there is no clear relationship between the two variables. Not applicable means the text does not suggest anything about the relationship between the two variables.

DOI_ 10_1159_000478785348that rumination can help to understand themselves bet_
ter_ research has shown that rumination aggravates nega_tive mood_ Moreover_ rumination has been identified as a core risk factor for depression with serious clinical im_plications due to more depressed mood_ longer depres_sive episodes and the occurrence of future depressive ep_isodes  
_7_10_  _ Recent studies indicate that depressive ru_
mination is connected to cognitive impairments in MDD_ It is discussed as an important underlying cognitive mechanism_ However_ there is little understanding of the extent to which rumination influences cognitive perfor_mance_ especially in single domains_
  Rumination and Cognitive Impairments  
 Resource allocation theory posits that rumination ab_
sorbs cognitive capacities which can thus not be directed towards task_relevant processes  
_11_13_  _ According to 
this theory_ valuable cognitive resources are allocated to irrelevant depressive and ruminative thought processes_ Indeed_ there are many findings that support the link be_tween reduced cognitive performance and rumination as put forward in the dual_process model of cognitive vul_nerability in depressed persons_ According to this model_ the ability of depressed individuals to implement correc_tive reflective processing in order to overcome automatic negative biases is impaired_ because this processing re_quires effort and cognitive resources that are not available  
_14_ _ Thus_ rumination might reduce  cognitive flexibility   
and raise interference levels above a critical threshold_ In line with these results_ Davis and Nolen_Hoeksema  
_15_  
showed that participants who scored high on a self_report measure of ruminative style made more perseverative er_rors than nonruminators in the Wisconsin card sorting test_ a widely used measure of  executive control   and  cogni_
tive flexibility  _
  In addition_ the dual_process model posits that the 
cognitive resources of depressed individuals might al_ready be strained by competing mood_congruent and ru_minative thought processes  
_14_ _ In particular the brood_
ing_ maladaptive component of rumination has been found to be associated with higher negative  attentional 
biases    
_16_ _ suggesting that depressed individuals with 
high levels of brooding have tightly connected negative schemata from which they have difficulty in breaking away_ Some scholars_ on the other hand_ have related ru_mination to major deficits in  cognitive control  _ regardless 
of the valence of the processed material_ Specifically_ ru_minators are thought to exhibit an impaired ability to flexibly shift  attention   or  inhibit  irrelevant information 
_e_g_  
15 _  17 __  Previous research has also reported that rumination is 
related to  memory deficits   and  memory biases   _18_ 19_  _ For 
example_ when people are asked to recall memories of specific autobiographical events_ depressed patients are more likely to retrieve overgeneral_ categorical memories that are summaries of repeated occasions than controls _for a review_ see  
20 __ Watkins et al_  _21_  found that the 
distraction induction _as a composite of rumination in_duction_ significantly reduced overgeneral memory at preinduction levels_ 
  Rumination has also been associated with  working 
memory   deficits_ Joormann and Gotlib  
_22_  proved a link 
between rumination_ impaired  working memory_   and de_
pression_ They found that the interference of negative ir_relevant words was correlated with self_reported rumina_tion_ This relation with rumination was limited to the MDD group and remained significant even after partial_ing out the level of depressive symptomatology_ the high_er the participants_ scored for the self_reported measure of rumination_ the greater their difficulty in removing task_irrelevant negative content from their working memory_ The connection between rumination and im_paired working memory was also reported by other au_thors  
_23_ 24_  _
  There have also been several experimental research 
studies on the effect of induced rumination on  executive 
functions   _e_g_  25_27  __ In the study by Watkins and Brown 
 _13_ _ for example_ the performance of depressed patients 
and nondepressed controls was compared for a random number generation task_ performed after either a rumina_tion or a distraction induction_ Compared with the dis_traction induction_ the rumination induction produced a significant increase in stereotyped counting responses _reflecting a failure of inhibitory executive control_ in de_pressed patients but not in controls_ However_ after dis_traction_ no difference was found between the 2 groups_ The authors concluded that the rumination induction may interfere with concurrent executive processing_
  In sum_ findings from the studies reviewed above ten_
tatively support a connection between rumination and deficits in cognitive performance_ However_ previous re_search on the impact of rumination on cognitive impair_ments in MDD has a number of shortcomings and has left open questions of which 3 seem especially important_ 
  Previous studies reported the influence of ruminative 
thinking on memory_ attention_ or executive functions_ However_ most studies have assessed only 1 or very few aspects of the specific domains such as attentional inflex_ibility_ cognitive control_ cognitive inflexibility_ or task switching_ So far there have been no studies that system_Downloaded from http___karger_com_psp_article_pdf_50_5_347_3492414_000478785_pdf by UNC Chapel Hill user on 09 January 2024

DOI_ 10_1159_000478785349atically examine all cognitive domains_ Therefore_ gen_
eral knowledge on the impact of rumination on different cognitive domains in MDD is still very limited_
  Furthermore_ many studies on rumination and cogni_
tive dysfunctions have not controlled for the influence of other factors such as the severity of depression_ the amount of depressive episodes in the past_ medication or duration of the current episode_ Previous research has shown that these factors can strongly influence the extent of cognitive deficits in MDD  
_28_ _ Moreover_ it seems es_
sential to control for general factors such as age_ patients_ intelligence_ or level of education  
_29_ _ However_ these 
factors have not been taken into consideration so far_ 
  Previous investigations have also failed to explore the 
relationship between rumination in everyday life and cognitive performance_ Most studies have assessed the in_fluence of rumination in an experimental design_ which required participants to complete several cognitive tasks after introducing rumination_ Therefore_ it stands to rea_son that rumination induced shortly before examination has an impact on the ability to solve cognitive tasks_ How_ever_ it is unclear as to whether depressive patients who ruminate a lot about themselves and their diseases in ev_eryday life also exhibit higher cognitive impairments than depressive patients whose tendency to ruminate in every_day life is not as pronounced_
  The current study aims at answering the above_men_
tioned questions_ thus closing a gap in research by sys_tematically analyzing the relationship between assessed everyday_life rumination and different cognitive func_tions in MDD by controlling for as many influencing fac_tors as possible_ Based on previous research_ we hypoth_esize that the severity of cognitive deficits in MDD is re_lated to ruminative thinking_
  Methods 
 Participants 
 The sample consisted of 62 outpatients _age 18_66 years_ 
mean _ 43_32_ SD _ 12_93_ 46 female_ currently diagnosed with MDD_ All participants fully met the criteria for a current unipolar MDD episode of the  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 
Disorders   _4th ed__ text rev__ DSM_IV_TR

Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM_IV _SCID_I  _31_ __ They 
were recruited for the study from a university teaching outpatient clinic_ Thirteen participants were diagnosed with comorbidity in addition to MDD_ dysthymia _10 participants__ bulimia nervosa _2 participants__ and undifferentiated somatoform disorder _1 par_ticipant__ Participants with comorbid anxiety disorder_ posttrau_matic stress disorder_ substance dependence_ a history of head in_jury_ neurological disease_ opioid or antipsychotic medication were excluded_ The clinical sample was divided into 2 groups_ low ruminators and high ruminators based on their scores on the Re_
sponse Style Questionnaire_ German version _RSQ_D_  
_32_ _ with a 
sum score of 40 and above indicating high rumination_ Thirty_six participants _22_ of low ruminators and 38_ of high ruminators_ were taking antidepressants_ Twenty_two participants were taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors_ 5 selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors_ 11 noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants_ 5 tricyclic antidepressants_ and 1 was taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors_
  Measures 
 Hamilton Depression Rating Scale  The 17_item version of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale

subdimensions in the areas of attention_ memory_ verbal working memory_ executive functions_ and processing speed and has been validated across neurological and psychiatric populations_
  Procedure 
 All participants were recruited from the outpatient psychother_
apy clinic of the University of Landau_ Germany_ where they asked for psychotherapy_ As it is usual routine of the outpatient clinic_ potential patients were invited for a first screening interview_ If depressive symptoms were identified and were of major concern to the patients_ they were informed of the study_ If they agreed to participate_ informed consent was obtained_ 
  The assessment was divided into two 1_h sessions_ In the first 
session_ trained interviewers administered the structured clinical Interview for the DSM_IV  
_36_  to participants to ensure that they 
fully met the criteria for a current unipolar MDD episode_ After_wards participants were interviewed regarding further criteria for being included in or excluded from the study and were rated on the HAMD  
_33_ _ In a next step_ they completed the RSQ_D  _32_ _ A 
few days after the first session_ participants came to our laboratory to complete the cognitive tasks with the neuropsychological test battery COGBAT_ All participants were tested individually after having completed the informed consent form_ The research was approved by the Local Research Ethics Committees_

DOI_ 10_1159_000478785352current depressive episode_ and the severity of depression 
as important predictors for cognitive impairments in MDD besides rumination_ 
  Our results indicate that cognitive impairments in 
MDD are linked to rumination in the domain of process_ing speed_ This was the only cognitive domain that was influenced by rumination after including other predic_tors in the hierarchical regression analysis_ To our knowl_edge_ there has been no previous research on the impact of rumination on processing speed_ This is_ however_ a basic cognitive domain which affects cognitive perfor_mance in general_ In line with these results_ previous stud_ies have suggested that cognitive impairments in depres_sion may be mediated in part or wholly by more basic deficits such as processing speed _e_g_  
37_39  __ These stud_
ies did not_ however_ examine the influence of rumination in this context_ It seems that rumination could be an un_derlying mechanism for the connection between process_ing speed and cognitive impairments in MDD_ Further research is needed to assess this relationship and to gen_eralize the findings if possible_
  Furthermore_ our findings are partially consistent with 
the results of Davis and Nolen_Hoeksema  
_15_ _ who ex_
amined the influence of self_reported rumination on ex_ecutive functions_ especially on executive control and cognitive flexibility_ In their study_ high ruminators made more preservative errors than nonruminators_ In line with this finding high_ruminating MDD patients of the current study reached a lower score in the executive do_main _indicating greater deficits_ than low ruminators_ The decreasing influence of rumination on the executive domain score in further calculations may be due to the fact that the range between high and low rumination in the current study is smaller than between the high and nonruminators in Davis and Nolen_Hoeksema_s  
_15_  in_
vestigation_
  In contrast to previous reports from experimental 
studies_ which showed an association between rumina_tion and attentional deficits _e_g_  
16 _  22 __ we found no 
significant difference between the 2 rumination groups in our analysis_ Furthermore_ our study does not support the existence of a link between rumination and memory def_icits as well as working memory deficits found by other researchers _e_g_  
23 _  24 __ In this context the findings of 
Teasdale et al_  _40_  and Antrobus  _41_  have to be taken 
into consideration_ They observed that increasing the cognitive demands of the current external task led to a reduction in the frequency of off_task thoughts_ resulting in an improvement in task performance_ These results suggest that attention_demanding tasks may disrupt ru_mination_ In the current study_ we observed rumination 
in the everyday life of patients_ with no rumination induc_tion_ For this reason_ one could argue that a 1_h neuro_psychological examination already constitutes an in_creased cognitive demand_ which interrupts rumination_ In this brief period of time_ participants of our study may exhibit a relative improvement in their cognitive perfor_mance compared to their performance in everyday life_
  Another important point should be taken into consid_
eration when interpreting the results concerning the in_fluence of rumination on memory_ Based on evidence from _choking under pressure_  
_42_ 43_  _ it is plausible to 
assume that rumination as a predominantly verbal phe_nomenon mainly absorbs verbal capacities_ Using a vi_sual but not a verbal memory test may cause less interfer_ence with rumination and therefore mask possible rela_tionships between rumination and memory_ This fact may Iimit the interpretations to a nonsignificant relation_ship between rumination and visual memory_ although there is a nonsignificant relationship between rumination and verbal working memory_
  To our knowledge_ the present investigation is the first 
that has attempted to systematically determine the impact of rumination on cognitive impairments in MDD in a broad range of cognitive domains_ A differentiated stan_dardization was available for each domain_ Another im_portant difference between the current study and the ma_jority of previous studies is the absence of induced rumi_nation_ Typically_ participants are induced to ruminate or distract from rumination_ before being asked to complete cognitive tasks_ These rumination and distraction induc_tions may produce stronger differences in cognitive per_formance in the laboratory compared to selecting par_ticipants based on their RSQ_D score_ 
  However_ there are some limitations to this study that 
should be addressed in future research_ The first limita_tion is due to the outpatient MDD sample_ Only 3 of 21 patients of the high_rumination group were male_ There_fore_ no conclusions can be drawn about the influence of gender_ Furthermore_ the variance of rumination scores in this sample was restricted_ therefore_ our results might underestimate the association between rumination and cognitive deficits_ Further research should extend the sample in addition to inpatients and healthy controls_ Secondly_ one could argue that the lack of impact of ru_mination on some cognitive domains is due to the com_puting of the neuropsychological variables_ Our cognitive performance parameters were computed by combining the test scores into a single index of specific cognitive do_mains_ The score of the attention domain demonstrated Downloaded from http___karger_com_psp_article_pdf_50_5_347_3492414_000478785_pdf by UNC Chapel Hill user on 09 January 2024

DOI_ 10_1159_000478785353moderate internal consistency __ _ 0_63_ and was below 
the recommended Cronbach _ of 0_70_ In this respect_ it is worth mentioning that the attention score was the only one with _ _ 0_70_ all other computed domain scores showed a high internal consistency __ _ 0_80__ The third problem concerns the unequal distribution of partici_pants_ The group of low ruminators was almost twice as large as that of the high ruminators_ This restricted only the mean value analyses on the basis of  t  tests_ but not the 
hierarchical regression analysis_ Finally_ it is also impor_tant to note that the present study did not allow us to draw any causal conclusions about the relationship between rumination and cognitive impairments in MDD_ Due to the limitations mentioned above_ it is important to verify whether our results can be generalized_
  The current findings offer new insights into the fre_
quently observed link between rumination and cognitive impairments in MDD_ We have proved that patients who tend to ruminate in everyday life only show limitations in processing speed_ but not a general reduction in their cog_nitive performance_ For a limited period of time they can exhibit the cognitive performance comparable to that of low ruminators_ Inpatients and healthy controls should be included in the samples of subsequent studies to enable 
generalization of this study_s findings_ Another question unanswered by this study concerns the point in time at which attention starts to tilt and provide space for rumi_nation under conditions of increasing cognitive demands_ These prevailing ruminating thoughts can occupy cogni_tive resources and lead to a decreased cognitive perfor_mance_ as shown in many experimental studies_ This question is highly relevant in everyday life and highlights the necessity for further investigations_

START PROMPT
Given the text validate a series of relationships between variables that will be included in a json format below.
For example, if the json includes a relation like "Country's per capita income -> Country's literacy rate", and the text includes "We find a strong correlation p < .0001 between a country's per capita income and it's literacy rate" then the RelationshipClassification would be direct.
If instead the text includes ""We find a strong inverse correlation p < .0001 between a country's per capita income and it's literacy rate" then the RelationshipClassification would be inverse.
The SupportText field of your output should include verbaitum text related to the relation between the two variables without paraphrasing.
The Reasoning field should be used to step by step reason from the text of the paper to try to come up with a good relationship classification and should focus on plainly stated results over implications.
The RelationshipClassification field can only be 'direct', 'inverse', 'not applicable', or 'uncorrelated'.
Direct means that an increase in one would cause a decrease in another, and inverse means that an increase in one would cause a decrease in another.
Uncorrelated means there is no clear relationship between the two variables. Not applicable means the text does not suggest anything about the relationship between the two variables. 
Use exactly wording of outputs choices and input variable names, including capitalization choices. 

OUTPUT FORMATTING INSTRUCTIONS START
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"Relations": {"title": "Relations", "type": "array", "items": {"$ref": "#/definitions/SingleRelation"}}}, "required": ["Relations"], "definitions": {"SingleRelation": {"title": "SingleRelation", "type": "object", "properties": {"VariableOneName": {"title": "Variableonename", "type": "string"}, "VariableTwoName": {"title": "Variabletwoname", "type": "string"}, "SupportingText": {"title": "Supportingtext", "type": "string"}, "Reasoning": {"title": "Reasoning", "type": "string"}, "RelationshipClassification": {"title": "Relationshipclassification", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["VariableOneName", "VariableTwoName", "SupportingText", "Reasoning", "RelationshipClassification"]}}}
