"Abstract\nDifficulty regulating emotions following stressful events is a hallmark of Major Depressive Disorder _MDD__ Although individuals_ ability to regulate their emotions is believed to have direct consequences for both emotional and physical wellbeing_ few studies have examined the cardiovascular effects of different emotion regulation strategies in MDD_ To the best of our knowledge_ the current study is the first to examine the effects of two emotion regulation strategies_ cognitive distraction and rumination_ on both self_reported sadness and respiratory sinus arrhythmia _RSA_ in individuals with MDD and healthy controls _CTLs__ Following a forced_failure stressor_ participants were randomly assigned to a rumination or cognitive distraction condition_ As expected_ rumination increased sadness and triggered RSA withdrawal for both MDDs and CTLs_ Interestingly_ although cognitive distraction reduced sadness_ it also triggered RSA withdrawal_ Moreover_ cognitive distraction was associated with greater RSA withdrawal for MDDs than CTLs_ Thus_ although depressed individuals are able to use cognitive distraction to emotionally recover from stress_ it may be associated with greater cognitive effort_ Adding low_cost physiological measures such as RSA into assessments has the potential to offer new and important information about the effects of emotion regulation on mental and physiological health_\n\nKeywords_ depression_ stress_ emotion regulation_ respiratory sinus arrhythmia_ autonomic nervous system\nExaggerated emotional and cardiovascular responses to stress are central characteristics of Major Depressive Disorder _MDD_ e_g__ Brown _ Harris_ 1986_ Lazarus _ Folkman_ 1984_ Monroe _ Hadjiyannakis_ 2002__ and can have detrimental effects on mental and physical wellbeing _for a review see Grippo _ Johnson_ 2009__ In fact_ an altered response to stress is a primary pathophysiological mechanism linking MDD to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality_ Although past research has focused on individual differences in the initial reactivity to stress_ studies increasingly emphasize the importance of examining individuals_ ability to regulate their emotions after the stressor ends _Flynn _ Rudolph_ 2007_ Nolen_Hoeksema_ Wisco_ _ Lyubomirsky_ 2008__ For example_ models of stress and health posit that emotion regulation strategies are critical determinants of emotional and cardiovascular health_ particularly for those with psychopathology _Brosschot_ Gerin_ _ Thayer_ 2006_ Kubzansky_ Davidson_ _ Rozanski_ 2005__ Despite this_ little is known about the effects of using different emotion regulation strategies on cardiovascular activity in MDD_\n\nThe parasympathetic nervous system plays an important role in regulating cardiovascular activity_ More specifically_ the parasympathetic nervous system influences oscillations in heart rate via its effect on the vagus nerve_ which affects heart rate acceleration and deceleration during respiration_ Whereas vagal activity is temporarily suppressed during inhalation_ causing heart rate to increase_ vagal activity resumes during exhalation_ causing heart rate to decrease_ Greater parasympathetic input leads to greater heart rate acceleration after inhalation and greater heart rate deceleration after exhalation_ Thus_ greater parasympathetic activity is associated with greater variability in the interval between heartbeats_ Respiratory sinus arrhythmia _RSA_ has been identified as an optimal marker of this beat_to_beat variation in heart rate linked to the respiratory cycle_ RSA offers advantages over other measures of the parasympathetic nervous system _e_g__ low_frequency heart rate variability_ given that it is unconfounded by sympathetic activation _Berntson_ Cacioppo_ _ Quigley_ 1993__ RSA also has advantages over other measures of biological functioning_ For one_ RSA is relatively inexpensive in that the per subject cost of data collection is minimal_ RSA data collection is also far less invasive than other methods for collecting biological data_ In fact_ with the development of technology to collect ambulatory RSA_ it is increasingly feasible to measure RSA data in applied research and clinical settings with minimal or no disruption to the individual _Cullins et al__ 2013_ Goedhart_ de Vries_ Kreft_ Bakker_ _ de Geus_ 2008_ Grossman_ Wilhelm_ _ Spoerle_ 2004__\n\nGiven the advantages of collecting RSA data_ it is not surprising that RSA is used frequently to index parasympathetic activity _see Berntson_ Cacioppo_ _ Grossman_ 2007_ for an overview__ Parasympathetic activity_ and thus RSA_ is high during times of rest_ when energy expenditure is actively reduced _e_g__ by inhibiting the sympathetic innervations of the heart_ Lovallo _ Thomas_ 2000_ Rottenberg_ 2007__ However_ when environmental demands become more challenging_ such as in a time of stress_ this _brake_ _Rottenberg_ 2007_ is rapidly withdrawn in order to meet environmental demands_ Thus_ adaptive parasympathetic responses to stress trigger moderate RSA withdrawal _Blair _ Peters_ 2003_ Kreibig_ 2010__ RSA withdrawal allows autonomic changes that prime the body for action and facilitate responses to environmental changes_ including better executive functioning and social competence _Blair _ Peters_ 2003_ Marcovitch et al__ 2010__ In contrast to adaptive physiological responses to stress_ exaggerated reactivity or delayed recovery _evidenced by greater or longer RSA withdrawal_ places the body under excessive strain and increases risk for cardiovascular and other organic diseases _Crowell_ Skidmore_ Rau _ Williams_ 2013__ To facilitate recovery_ the body activates the parasympathetic nervous system_ leading to increased RSA_ Individual differences in the use of emotion regulation strategies may be associated with different amounts of parasympathetic activation_ and these differences may be particularly relevant for individuals with MDD_ who are at greater risk for poor health outcomes_ including cardiovascular disease _Keicolt_Gaser _ Glaser_ 2002__\n\nPast research on emotion regulation and recovery from stress in MDD focuses largely on self_reported sadness_ Whereas adaptive emotion regulation strategies facilitate recovery from stress_ maladaptive emotion regulation strategies prolong depressed mood_ Distraction is typically considered an adaptive emotion regulation strategy in the short_term given that it decreases sadness and facilitates engagement in behaviors that are likely to further improve mood _Donaldson _ Lam_ 2004_ Watkins_ Teasdale_ _ Williams_ 2000__ Both healthy controls and individuals with MDD are able to effectively down_regulate negative emotions when exposed to a distraction induction _for a review see Nolen_Hoeksema et al__ 2008__ Unlike healthy controls_ however_ individuals with MDD do not often spontaneously engage in distraction in everyday life_ This may be due_ in part_ to the fact that it is difficult for depressed individuals to disengage from negative thoughts_ resulting in an unproductive pattern of ruminative thinking _Joormann_ 2010_ Nolen_Hoeksema_ Morrow_ _ Fredrickson_ 1993__ The response styles theory _Nolen_Hoeksema_ 1991_ Nolen_Hoeksema et al__ 2008_ defines rumination as repeatedly thinking about negative feelings and the potential antecedents or repercussions of those feelings_ In contrast to distraction_ ruminative responses to stress increase the duration and severity of depressed moods _Nolen_Hoeksema et al__ 1993__\n\nAlthough the emotional consequences of rumination and distraction have been well established _see Lyubomirsky _ Tkach_ 2004_ and Nolen_Hoeksema et al__ 2008_ for reviews__ less is known about the effects of these emotion regulation strategies on RSA_ Initial evidence indicates that both anger and depressive rumination are associated with parasympathetic withdrawal _Key_ Campbell_ Bacon_ _ Gerin_ 2008_ Ottaviani_ Shapiro_ Davydov_ Goldstein_ _ Mills_ 2009__ whereas distraction is associated with parasympathetic activation _Gerin_ Davidson_ Christenfeld_ Goyal_ _ Schwartz_ 2006_ Ottaviani et al__ 2009_ Ottaviani et al__ 2011__ The majority of studies use passive distraction tasks_ which involve passively viewing neutral movies or images _Gerin et al__ 2006_ or overhearing a fabricated phone conversation _Ottaviani et al__ 2009_ 2011__ By contrast_ other studies use cognitive distraction tasks_ which require greater cognitive control and demand_ Cognitive distraction has been shown to be effective at improving negative mood _Eisenberg _ Morris_ 2003_ Eisenberg_ Morris_ _ Spinrad_ 2008__ The effect of cognitive distraction on parasympathetic activity_ however_ is more uncertain and has not been examined in MDD_\n\nThe primary goal of the current study was to compare clinically depressed and healthy control participants_ parasympathetic activity during a rumination and cognitive distraction induction_ In the process_ we hoped to demonstrate the importance and feasibility of adding physiological measures to assessments of emotion regulation_ In this study_ participants were exposed to a forced_failure stressor_ selected for its ability both to induce sad mood _Hammen_ 2005_ and to trigger biological changes _Kirschbaum_ Pirke_ _ Hellhammer_ 1993__ Following the forced_failure task_ participants were randomly assigned either to ruminate on their poor performance or to cognitively distract themselves from it_ We measured RSA reactivity before and during the forced_failure and emotion regulation periods_ Whereas we expected rumination to be associated with RSA withdrawal in both the MDD and control groups_ we expected cognitive distraction to be associated with RSA activation in both groups_\n\nMethod\nParticipants\nInclusion and exclusion criteria for the current study were determined via an in_person Structured Clinical Interview for DSM_IV _SCID_ First_ Spitzer_ Gibbon_ _ Williams_ 2002__ which was conducted by trained graduate students_ Strong inter_rater reliability was established_ _ _ 1_00_ Participants were included if they were between the ages of 18 and 60 and were in one of two groups_ those who met criteria for current major depressive disorder _MDD_ n _ 47__ and those who did not meet criteria for any past or current Axis I disorder _Control_ CTL_ n _ 51__ Participants were excluded due to severe head trauma_ learning disabilities_ bipolar disorder_ psychotic symptoms_ alcohol or substance abuse within the past six months_ or medical conditions that would affect psychophysiological recordings _e_g__ heart murmur__ Data from 7 participants with MDD and 4 CTLs could not be included due to excessive movement artefacts or signal error_ Thus_ the final sample included 40 participants in the MDD group and 47 in the CTL group_\n\nForced_Failure Stressor\nThree forced_failure tasks were used to elicit distress_ The first was a facial identification task with false feedback indicating that the participant performed poorly_ This 10_minute task was adapted from Tran_ Siemer_ and Joormann _2011__ Participants were asked to identify the emotional expression _happy_ sad_ angry_ depicted in subliminally presented facial expressions_ Participants repeatedly received feedback that they were performing poorly relative to others who had already completed the task_ and the experimenter urged participants to try harder_ The second task was an anagram task_ in which approximately 30_ of the anagrams were unsolvable_ Participants were given 5 minutes to solve as many anagrams as possible but allowed only 30 seconds to solve each anagram_ In the third task_ participants were given 5 minutes to count backward aloud from 2_083 to zero in 13_step sequences _Kirschbaum et al__ 1993__\n\nRumination and Distraction Induction\nParticipants were randomly assigned to either a rumination or cognitive distraction condition_ which was adapted from the standard rumination and distraction _R_D_ task created by Nolen_Hoeksema and Morrow _1993__ Regardless of the condition_ participants viewed seven prompts one_at_a_time on the computer screen_ and they were asked to think and write about each prompt for two minutes_ Rumination prompts focused participants_ attention on thoughts that were emotion or self_focused _e_g__ _why your performance on the tests earlier today made you feel the way it did_ or _what people would think of you if they had observed you complete the tests earlier today___ In contrast_ cognitive distraction prompts focused participants_ attention on thoughts unrelated to the self _e_g__ _how to make a peanut_butter_and_jelly sandwich_ Describe it in detail_ with as many steps as possible__ or _the layout of your local mall_ Walk the entire length in your mind and describe the stores_ things_ or people you would see___ Participants_ written statements were later coded based on Hilt and Pollak _2013_ by two independent raters who were blind to group and condition_ Rumination score ratings were made on a 5_point Likert scale ranging from 1 _Not at all ruminating_ to 5 _Completely ruminating__ ICC _ _84_\n\nMeasures\nSadness ratings We examined sadness ratings assessed at 4 points_ at the end of the baseline period_ in the middle of the forced_failure induction_ immediately before the R_D induction_ and immediately after the R_D induction_ Participants rated their sadness on an 11_point Likert_scale ranging from 0 _not at all_ to 10 _very much__ We focused on sadness as opposed to other metrics of affect _e_g__ general negative affect_ given that sadness is central to MDD_ a common response to forced_failure stressors _Hammen_ 2005__ and the affective dimension most directly targeted by our rumination induction _Nolen_Hoeksema _ Morrow_ 1993__\nRespiratory sinus arrhythmia _RSA_ Electrocardiograph _ECG_ and respiration frequency were recorded with a computer_based data acquisition system _MP150_ Biopac Systems__ Three standard electrodes were attached bilaterally to participants_ left and right upper rib cage and right collarbone_ To measure respiration frequency_ a strain_gauge transducer belt was attached around the chest above the ribcage and below the bust_ Data was collected using BIOPAC bioamplifiers_ The ECG and respiration frequency signals were sampled at a rate of 1_000 Hz_ digitized with a 16_bit analog_to_digital converter_ and processed using AcqKnowledge and MindWare software_ Following recommendations of the Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology _1996__ we used a frequency domain measure of heart rate variability_ namely RSA_ Thus_ vagal activation was indexed by measuring heart rate variability in the frequency band between _14 and _4 Hz _high frequency_ heart rate variability__ R_wave markers in the ECG signal were evaluated for artifacts by visual inspection and the MAD_MED artifact detection algorithm implemented in MindWare software _Mindware Heart Rate Variability Application_ version 2_51_ Mindware Technologies Ltd___ Identified artifacts were then manually corrected_ Beat_to_beat interval series were obtained from the ECG and converted into time series of instantaneous beat_to_beat intervals with a resolution of 4 Hz_ Spectral analysis using the Welch method determined the power spectral density in the frequency band between _14 and _4 Hz_ This value is then automatically log_transformed to correct for the non_normal distribution_ and minute_by_minute estimates of RSA were determined_ This approach accords with best_practice guidelines for frequency domain methods to calculate RSA _Berntson et al__ 1993_ Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology_ 1996__ Data were then analyzed in 5_minute increments_ or as close to this interval as tasks would allow_ Specifically_ RSA was measured during the following four periods_ 1_ During the 5_minute nature video _baseline__ which occurred immediately before the forced_failure stressor_ 2_ During the first 5 minutes of the forced_failure stressor_ 3_ During the 5 minutes immediately before the R_D induction_ when participants were completing the forced_failure stressor _approximately 15_20 minutes after the forced_failure onset__ and 4_ During the first 6 minutes of the R_D induction _i_e__ during the first three R_D prompts__\nQuestionnaires Participants completed the Beck Depression Inventory_II _BDI_ Beck_ Steer_ _ Brown_ 1996__ a 21_item measure assessing depressive symptom severity __ _ _97__ Additionally_ participants completed the Ruminative Responses Scale of the Response Style Questionnaire _RRS_ Nolen_Hoeksema _ Morrow_ 1991__ a 22_item self_report questionnaire assessing individual differences in the tendency to ruminate when sad __ _ _99__\nProcedure\nAfter participants provided informed consent_ approximately 5 minutes were taken to attach psychophysiological equipment and ensure the accurate collection of RSA data_ Participants then watched a 5_minute nature video followed by the forced_failure stressor_ Next_ participants were randomly assigned to the rumination or cognitive distraction condition of the R_D induction_ Before leaving the laboratory_ participants watched a calming nature video in order to provide ample time for mood to return to baseline_ Participants completed demographic and clinical questionnaires at the end of the experiment_\n\nData Analysis\nAnalyses were conducted with SPSS version 20_0_ Baseline and demographic data were analyzed via one_way analysis of variance _ANOVA_ and chi square tests_ To examine the effect of the forced_failure stressor and R_D induction on self_reported sadness and RSA_ we examined the changes in sadness and RSA as a result of the forced_failure stressor and R_D induction_ For example_ sadness reactivity to the forced_failure stressor was calculated as sadness rated during the forced_failure induction minus sadness at baseline_ Sadness reactivity to the R_D induction was calculated as sadness rated after the R_D induction minus sadness immediately before the R_D induction_ Positive scores indicate increases in sadness_ negative scores indicate decreases in sadness_ Similarly_ RSA reactivity during the forced_failure stressor was calculated as RSA measured during the first five minutes of the forced_failure stressor minus RSA measured during the five minutes immediately before the forced_failure stressor_ RSA reactivity during the R_D induction was calculated as RSA measured during the first six minutes of the R_D induction minus RSA measured during the five minutes immediately before the R_D induction_ Positive scores indicate RSA activation_ negative scores indicate RSA withdrawal_ Univariate ANOVAs were used to examine reactivity and recovery scores by group _MDD_ CTL_ and condition _rumination_ cognitive distraction__\n\nGo to_\nResults\nParticipant and Baseline

to rumination and distraction in MDD_ little is known about the consequences of using these emotion regulation strategies on RSA_ To the best of our knowledge_ the current study is the first to examine whether clinically depressed and healthy control participants display different affective and parasympathetic responses to a rumination and cognitive distraction induction_ As expected_ rumination increased sadness and triggered RSA withdrawal for both MDDs and CTLs_ Interestingly_ although cognitive distraction reduced sadness_ it also triggered RSA withdrawal_ Moreover_ cognitive distraction was associated with greater RSA withdrawal for MDDs than CTLs_ For MDDs_ RSA withdrawal was also greater during cognitive distraction than rumination_\n\nRSA withdrawal during rumination is in line with numerous studies reporting that both anger and depressive rumination is associated with less parasympathetic activation in analogue samples _e_g__ Gerin et al__ 2006_ Key et al__ 2008_ Ottaviani et al__ 2009__ It also parallels the broader literature_ which finds cardiovascular activation during perseverative thinking _ including worry_ rumination_ or trauma recall _ in analogue samples _Brosschot et al__ 2006_ Verkuil et al__ 2009__ Our data extend this literature by comparing clinically depressed and healthy control participants_ Results demonstrate that the effect of rumination on RSA withdrawal did not significantly differ between MDDs and CTLs_ This finding is relevant to models of cardiovascular disease that include rumination as a mechanism through which MDD heightens risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality _Brosschot et al__ 2006_ Rozanski_ Blumenthal_ _ Kaplan_ 1999_ Rugulies_ 2002__ More specifically_ results from our study suggest that depressed individuals may be at heightened risk for cardiovascular disease not because rumination has a greater effect on RSA in MDDs than in CTLs_ but because MDDs spend more time using an emotion regulation strategy that is associated with parasympathetic withdrawal_ Given that rumination produced similar RSA withdrawal in the MDD and CTL groups_ models of cardiovascular risk might include not only the cardiovascular effects of rumination but also the frequency with which individuals ruminate in everyday life_\n\nIn addition_ the current study examined the effects of cognitive distraction on RSA and found RSA withdrawal instead of RSA activation_ Our results stand in contrast to observations of cardiovascular recovery during passive distraction _e_g__ Gerin et al__ 2006_ Ottaviani et al__ 2008_ Ottaviani et al__ 2009__ For example_ cardiovascular recovery from stress _ indexed via increased parasympathetic activity or decreased sympathetic activity _ has been observed when passively viewing neutral pictures and posters _Gerin et al__ 2006_ or when distracted by overhearing a fabricated phone conversation _Ottaviani et al__ 2008_ 2009_ 2011__ An important difference between our distraction task and passive distraction tasks is that our task required participants to engage in effortful control over their thoughts_ In fact_ it is this effort that has been posited to drive parasympathetic withdrawal during cognitive tasks _Luft et al__ 2009_ Reynard et al__ 2011__ Interestingly_ greater effort has long been associated with parasympathetic withdrawal _Lundberg _ Frankenhaeuser_ 1980__ Moreover_ evidence from other experimental paradigms shows that tasks requiring cognitive effort lead to parasympathetic withdrawal _Duschek_ Muckenthaler_ Werner_ _ Reys del Paso_ 2009_ Luft_ Takase_ _ Darby_ 2009_ Reynard_ Gevirtz_ Berlow_ Brown_ _ Boutelle_ 2011_ Verkuil_ Brosschot_ Borkovec_ _ Thayer_ 2009_ although see also Butler_ Wilhelm_ _ Gross_ 2006_ and Segerstrom _ Solberg Nes_ 2007_ for evidence of parasympathetic activation__ For example_ studies report less parasympathetic activity when participants control the content of thoughts by thinking and writing about an assigned topic compared to baseline parasympathetic activity _Reynard et al__ 2011_ or when participants think about moral questions __Is it appropriate for your friend to misrepresent his curriculum vitae in order to get a job___ Verkuil et al__ 2009__ Luft et al_ _2009_ also reported lower parasympathetic activity during tasks requiring high versus low cognitive effort_ More specifically_ greater parasympathetic withdrawal was observed during a one_back working memory task compared to a simple reaction time task_\n\nWe also observed greater RSA withdrawal during cognitive distraction in the MDD versus CTL group_ Given evidence connecting effort and parasympathetic withdrawal _Lundberg _ Frankenhaeuser_ 1980__ greater RSA withdrawal in the MDD group could reflect greater effort required for depressed individuals to engage in cognitive distraction following sadness_inducing failure_ This interpretation is in line with behavioral data showing that depressed participants are slower to disengage from negative material _see reviews by Gotlib _ Joormann_ 2010_ Joormann_ 2010_ Koster_ De Lissnyder_ Derakshan_ _ De Raedt_ 2011__ It is further supported by evidence that depressed individuals show greater activation in brain regions subserving cognitive control _dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and the insula_ when removing negative material from working memory _Foland_Ross_ Hamilton_ Joormann_ Berman_ Jonidees_ _ Gotlib_ 2013__ Furthermore_ during cognitive distraction_ individuals with remitted depression exhibited increased neural activity compared to healthy controls in the regulating control_network_ including the anterior cingulate _Kanske_ Heissler_ Sch_nfelder_ _ Wessa_ 2012__ The idea of cognitive effort leading to parasympathetic withdrawal is also in line with research showing lower parasympathetic activity in other clinical groups when using adaptive_ yet effortful_ emotion regulation strategies _Aldao _ Mennin_ 2012__ Specifically_ Aldao and Mennin found that individuals with generalized anxiety disorder exhibited lower parasympathetic activity when using acceptance or reappraisal to regulate their emotions compared to when passively viewing a film_ Importantly_ in the current study_ despite group differences in parasympathetic withdrawal during cognitive distraction_ both healthy controls and clinically depressed participants were able to use distraction to repair the sad mood that was induced during the forced_failure period_ Thus_ although cognitive distraction appears to facilitate emotional recovery from stress_ it may be associated with greater cognitive effort for individuals with MDD_ In fact_ for individuals with MDD_ RSA withdrawal was even greater during cognitive distraction than rumination_ further emphasizing the effort required for this population to engage in cognitive distraction_ The fact that we observed a different pattern of findings for RSA and self_reported affect in the MDD versus CTL group underscores the importance of adding physiological measures to clinical assessments_\n\nIt is also noteworthy that_ in this study_ baseline RSA did not differ between MDD and CTL participants_ Interestingly_ the literature on baseline RSA in depression is mixed_ Whereas some studies report lower RSA levels in depressed compared to control participants _Dalack _ Roose_ 1990_ Lehofer et al__ 1999_ Rottenberg_ Clift_ Bolden_ _ Salomon_ 2007__ others report no differences in RSA levels _e_g__ Lehofer et al__ 1997_ Moser et al__ 1998__ Although a meta_analysis conducted by Rottenberg _2007_ found that depression was associated with lower levels of resting RSA _d _ _33__ only 6 of the 39 comparisons indicated a significant difference between depressed and control participants_ and depression accounted for only about 2_ of the variance in RSA_ Moreover_ Rottenberg _2007_ concludes that the overall effect of depression on RSA likely reflects an upper_bound estimate that may be very modest after accounting for confounds and unpublished studies_ thereby casting doubt on the effects of depression on baseline RSA_ When incorporating our findings on baseline RSA into the broader literature_ it is important to consider the fact that we measured baseline RSA while participants were watching a calming nature video_ which may have served as a passive distraction task_ which has been shown to increase parasympathetic activity _Gerin et al__ 2006_ Ottaviani et al__ 2009_ 2011__ We_ therefore_ caution against direct comparison between baseline RSA measured in the current study with that measured in studies where participants are not engaging in any activity_\n\nThe current study has several limitations_ For one_ comorbid health conditions were determined based on participants_ self report_ and it is possible that participants may have been unaware of prior cardiovascular conditions that would have affected RSA_ However_ using reactivity and recovery_ as opposed to raw scores_ minimized external sources of variability_ Nonetheless_ future work might consider including a physical checkup_ Future studies might also include additional measures of cardiovascular health_ including blood pressure or pre_ejection period _PEP__ A second limitation is that the current study did not directly assess self_reported effort_ which prevents us from drawing a direct connection between effort and parasympathetic withdrawal during the cognitive distraction induction_ Lastly_ despite random assignment to the cognitive distraction and rumination conditions_ there was an unequal proportion of female participants across cells_ Importantly_ however_ the group by condition interaction on RSA recovery remained significant when sex was included in the model_\n\nDespite these limitations_ the current study offers a unique examination of parasympathetic activity during a rumination and cognitive distraction induction in clinically depressed versus healthy control participants_ Findings demonstrate that the effect of rumination on RSA did not significantly differ between the MDD and CTL groups_ In addition_ the current study provides the first evidence of the effects of cognitive distraction on RSA in MDD_ Our results demonstrate that distraction leads to greater parasympathetic withdrawal_ indexed via RSA withdrawal_ for MDDs than CTLs_ which may reflect that depressed individuals require additional effort to disengage from negative material_ We hope that this study also demonstrates the importance and feasibility of incorporating physiological measures into assessments of emotion regulation_ Assessing RSA activity can provide information about parasympathetic activation that cannot be obtained from self_report measures_ Thus_ information on RSA could help understand the effects of different emotion regulation strategies on patients_ physical health_ which is especially relevant for patients with comorbid health conditions_ In addition_ to the extent that RSA withdrawal indexes cognitive effort_ examining changes in RSA during cognitive distraction may prove a useful tool to assess skill integration as treatment progresses_ With practice_ cognitive distraction should become less effortful for depressed individuals_ leading to less RSA withdrawal_ These assessment options are possible given that RSA provides a low_cost physiological measure that can be assessed with minimal disruption in applied research and clinical settings_ With the development of devices to collect ambulatory RSA_ barriers to data collection have decreased even further_ Future work might examine parasympathetic activation during other emotion regulation strategies_ including the use of emotion regulation strategies in naturalistic settings_ Additionally_ investigators conducting research in applied or clinical settings might test whether parasympathetic withdrawal during cognitive distraction decreases with treatment or practice_\n\nGo to_\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported by grant F31_MH086246_\n\nGo to_\nFootnotes\n1Including sex as a covariate did not affect the

study compared EMSs between BD and MDD\nduring remission_ The results revealed that the BD group\nscored higher than the MDD group on most of the EMS\nscales_ and for seven EMSs_ the differences were statisticallysigni_cant_ abandonment_ failure to achieve_ insuf _cient\nself_control_ subjugation_ unrelenting standards_ enmesh_\nment and entitlement_ These _ndings extends previous\n_ndings by Hawke and Provencher _2012_ by suggesting\nthat EMSs also tend to be more severe in BD compared withMDD during remission_\nThe_ndings may be interpreted through a schema\ntheory lens_ According to Young et al_ _2003__ temperamental\ndispositions interact with need_thwarting or traumatic earlylife experiences in the formation of EMSs_ Studies suggestthat BD_ compared with MDD_ is associated with morechildhood traumas _Hyun_ Friedman_ _ Dunner_ 2000_ andtemperamental dysregulation _Matsumoto et al __ 2005_\nNowakowska et al__ 2005_ Savitz_ van der Merwe_ _\nRamesar_ 2008__ Thus_ a higher prevalence of the pro_posed origins of EMSs in BD may explain the greaterEMS severity in this disorder compared with MDD_Moreover_ since EMSs purportedly continue their forma_tions in adulthood _Young et al__ 2003__ the illness course\nof mood disorder may be assumed to play a role in their\nformation_ Compared with MDD_ BD is characterizedby more frequent depres sive episodes _Forty et al__ 2008__\nmore comorbid anxiety disorders and personality disor_ders _Moreno et al__ 2012_ and an earlier illness onset\n_Tondo_ Lepri_ Cruz_ _ Baldessarini_ 2010_ Weissmanet al__ 1996__ A more pervasive illness course in BD may\nbe conceived as having detrimental effects that contributeto the higher EMS severity in this group compared withMDD_\nThe_ndings may be considered in terms of their clinical\nimplications_ Schema therapy _ST_ Young et al__ 2003__ a\npsychotherapeutic treatment which speci _cally targets\nEMSs_ has been found to have comparable ef _cacy with\ncognitive behaviour therapy in the treatment of MDD_Carter et al__ 2013__ Considering the higher EMS severity\nin BD compared with MDD_ as indicated by the presentstudy_ it is pertinent to contemplate whether ST wouldhave additional treatment effects if applied to BD_ Hawke_\nProvenche_ and Parikhb _2013_ have proposed a modi _ed\nversion of ST for BD which emphasizes mood stabilizationand prevention of affective relapses and recurrences_ Thus_the effects of ST tailored the symptomatology of BD seemrelevant to investigate in future treatments studies_\nA number of methodological drawbacks need to be con_\nsidered when interpreting the _ndings_ First_ as described\nelsewhere _Halvorsen et al__ 2009_ Halvorsen et al__ 2010_\nNilsson_ 2012_ Nilsson et al__ 2010a__ the assessment proce_\ndures used at two data_collection sites differed with regardto speci _c symptom measures and initial recruitmentstrategies_ The present _ndings should therefore be consid_\nered provisional and in need of further replication_ Second_due to the cross_sectional design_ the present study did notprovide any insights into causal mechanisms underlyingEMSs in the two mood disorders_ The development ofEMSs in mood disorders therefore remains to be eluci_dated by longitudinal research_\nIn conclusion_ by suggesting that EMSs overall are more\nsevere in BD compared with MDD during remission_ the_ndings elaborate the understanding of differences be_\ntween the two mood disorders_ Moreover_ the _ndings\nhighlight potential vulnerabilities in BD_ which meritfurther investigation in terms of their

Psychiatry 02 frontiersin_orgIntroduction\nMajor depressive disorder _MDD_ is a leading burden of disease \nglobally_ This trend has been enhanced by the COVID_19 pandemic \n_1__ and the burden is in large part due to the high rates of relapse \nseen in MDD _ 2__ New episodes are linked with persisting residual \nsymptoms following affective remission including subthreshold \ndepressive symptoms_ fatigue_ sleep problems_ rumination_ and \ncognitive deficits _ 3__ contributing to relapse or recurrence and a \nmore severe courses of illness _ 4__ A large meta_analysis found small \nto large effects sizes for cognitive deficits in remitted MDD \npopulations_ measured objectively by neuropsychological tests_ \nacross most domains of cognitive functioning_ excluding  auditory \nattention_ general cognitive ability_ autobiographical memory_ in \naddition to inhibition unconstrained by speed _ 5__ In addition_ self_\nreported subjective cognitive difficulties _subjective deficits_ are \nprevalent in acute states of MDD _ 6__ and as residual cognitive \nsymptoms following MDD _ 7_ 8__ Subjective deficits are of clinical \nrelevance and are associated with lower quality of life and poorer \nfunctioning following MDD _ 9__ and could contribute to the \nalarming rate of relapse seen in MDD _ 10_ 11__ Perhaps surprisingly_ \nsubjective deficits show small associations to cognitive deficits \nmeasured by objective experimental and clinical neuropsychological \ntests _ 5_ 12_ A meta_analysis investigating the correlation between \nsubjective and objective measures of cognition found small \nsignificant associations between some measures_ with most \nconsistent effects between questionnaires measuring shifting and \ntests measuring shifting _ 13__ Some studies suggest that subjective \ncognition show associations to symptoms of MDD rather than to \nneuropsychological tests _ 14_ 15__ In the research literature objective \ncognitive tests performed in a controlled environment is \nrecommended as a measure of cognitive deficits in depression _ 16__ \nSelf_reported cognition could be_considered complementary to the \nperformance on objective cognitive tests and measure different \naspects of ecologically important _dys_function _ 12_ 17_19__ \nImportantly_ cognitive deficits are not fully remediated by \ntraditional treatments _ 20_ 21__ and a few interventions target \nresidual cognitive difficulties in the remitted phase of MDD_ \nincluding medication_ brain stimulation and cognitive remediation \n_22__ Little is known_ however_ about the long_term effects of \ninterventions targeting cognition following MDD_ as was evident \nby a recent meta_analysis _ 23__ There is also a lack of research \nreporting long_term outcomes in subjective cognitive deficits_ with \na few exceptions _ 24_28__ Overall_ the results from these studies \nreporting short_ and long_term outcomes have been mixed Thus_ \nexploring how new interventions influence subjective deficits over \ntime is of importance_\nAnother important residual cognitive symptom following \nMDD is rumination_ Rumination is an emotion regulation strategy \nwere one passively brood over self_related negative experiences \nand is hypothesized to be_related to deficits in working memory \n_WM_ for negative material_ sometimes termed hot_cognition  _26_ \n29_31__ Associations between objective cognitive tests and \nrumination are small_ but significant associations have been \nestablished for WM _ 3__ and subjective cognition _ 24__ Rumination \nis a central risk factor following remission of mood symptoms \n_32__ and predict relapse in remitted populations _ 4_ 33_ 34__ Thus_ \ndeficits in cognition are suspected to be_related to rumination_ however_ relationships to subjective deficits are unclear _ 24__ and \na recent review suggested that subjective deficits could cause \nrumination about not living up to one_s premorbid level_ and thus \nincrease relapse risk following MDD _ 19__ Interventions \nimproving cognition could thus reduce subjective deficits and \nrumination following MDD_ Interventions like computerized \nworking memory training _CWMT__ could result in improvement \nof residual cognitive symptoms following depression _ 10_ 23__ \nCWMT has been shown to improve objective cognitive functions \nlike executive functions and associations between rumination and \nWM for negative material _ 23_ 35__ Results are mixed regarding \nwhether interventions like CWMT improves rumination however_ \nwith studies finding support for improvements in some residual \nsymptoms like objective cognitive deficits_ but not all_ symptoms \nlike subjective cognitive deficits_ depressive symptoms_ and some \naspects of rumination _ 19_ 36_ 37__ Even less is known about \nsubjective deficits _ 19_ 25_ 26__ and the lasting effects of \ninterventions_ with preliminary reports suggesting long term \nimprovements in rumination and depressive symptoms_ but not \nsubjective deficits _ 25__ Given the high relapse rate and \nincremental relapse risk in MDD_ knowledge about the lasting \neffects of interventions targeting residual cognitive symptoms \nis vital_\nSupplying and accessing interventions targeting residual \nsymptoms in remission from MDD can be_challenging_ as there are \nlimited resources such as trained therapists in health care systems to \ndeliver targeted treatment_ particularly in remission _ 4__ One \npromising approach is to deliver pro_cognitive interventions digitally \nas this could increase access_ agency_ and reduce costs _ 38__ A strength \nwithin the research field is that many pro_cognitive interventions are \nalready delivered online or are computerized _ 23__ However_ digital \ndelivery might have implications for motivation and engagement _ 39__ \nIt has therefore been suggested that that sufficient guidance by \ntherapists can increase motivation and engagement _ 40__ In sum_ \ngiven limited studies in this area_ there is a need to further investigate \nthe long_term effects of on cost effective interventions on clinically \nrelevant residual cognitive symptom like subjective deficits \nand rumination_\nThe current study investigated the long_term effects of a \ncomprehensive digitally delivered CWMT intervention_ If CWMT \nimproves working memory _WM_ control for negative material in \nhot_cognition_ associated with rumination _ 35_ 41__ rumination would \ndecline over time following CWMT_ Ronold et_al_ _ 35_ investigated \nCWMT effects on hot_ and cold cognition_ rumination_ and depressive \nsymptoms and found significantly improved effects on the two former_ \nbut not the latter_ However_ WM improvements could generalize to \ndaily function_ e_g__ self_perceived cognitive function over time_ and a \nstudy found associations between subjective deficits and later quality \nof life and psychosocial function _ 9__ suggesting that long term \ndevelopment is important to investigate_ Also improvements over time \ncould reduce ruminative tendencies_ It was thus hypothesized that \nCWMT would yield durable effects in self_reported cognitive function \nand rumination_ The following research questions were investigated_\n_How does self_reported cognitive function _subjective deficits_ and \nrumination develop_two_year following CWMT_\n_Is CWMT improvement related to improvement in subjective \ndeficits or rumination_Ronold et al_ 10_3389_fpsyt_2023_1163073\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 03 frontiersin_orgMethods\nParticipants and

\nimprovements increased even 1 year after the intervention_ this could \nprobably not fully explain results_ The moderate association between \nimprovement in self_reported subjective cognitive difficulties and the \ntraining paradigm could suggest specific effects of WM training on self_\nreported cognitive functions in daily life and might thus represent an \nexample of far transfer effects_ or at least near transfer across domains_ \nFindings could be_relevant to relapse prevention because of this_ however \nmore methodological rigorous controlled studies should investigate \nthis further_\nStrengths_ limitations_ and suggestions for \nfuture research\nThis is the first study to report on the effects of digitally delivered \ncognitive enhancement interventions after two_years on residual cognitive \nsymptoms_ However_ sample sizes were small__ dropout considerable_ but \ncomparable to other studies in the literature _ 23_ 25__ There were no \ndifferences on demographic or outcome variables between those \ncompleting the intervention and dropping out at pre intervention_ \nhowever_ attrition effects cannot be_ ruled out_ and some participants \nmight have relapsed during training and follow up_ The study was \nunderpowered to detect small changes_ Thus_ acceptability could be_a \nchallenge in the current study_ Previous studies_ however_ suggested that \nthe current CWMT paradigm is both acceptable and feasible to use _ 10_ \n49__ No objective neuropsychological assessments of cognitive functions \nwere reported_ limiting generalizability to cognitive deficits on behavioral \ntasks_ However_ subjectively experienced cognitive difficulties could be_of \nclinical relevance in the remitted phase_ as it could be_associated with risk \nof depression relapse and poorer outcomes following MDD _ 19__ Another \nlimitation concerning outcome measures is not including a functional \ntransfer measure of cognitive effects_ which is recommended to investigate cognitive interventions generalizability _ 50__ Sample_ and demand \ncharacteristics could partly explain results_ and future studies should \ninvestigate factors related to drop out_ include more participants_ and \nimplement designs controlling for these variables_ In addition_ the \nincreasing improvements in subjective cognition over time suggested that \nit might take time for effects to generalize_ and thus longitudinal studies \nof cognitive remediation with longer follow up time might be_feasible_ \nHowever_ due to the high drop_out_ longitudinal studies with digital \nfollow up assessment might be_more optimal for acceptability following \nCWMT interventions_ and future longitudinal studies should plan \nfor this_\nConclusion\nA group completing digitally delivered CWMT showed reduced \nlevels of subjective cognitive deficits two_years following \nimplementation_ This shows significant promise in effective and \navailable relapse prevention strategies_ Thus_ the digitally delivered \nworking memory training shows promise in reducing subjective \ndifficulties following MDD_ and long_term effects of digitally delivered \ninterventions could be_comparable or supersede those seen in the \nlimited research on interventions delivered in the clinic_ However_ \ngiven the methodological qualities of the current study_ more \ncontrolled replication of results should be_ done_ There were no \nsignificant improvements in rumination_ underscoring the importance \nof continuing to develop interventions targeting important residual

the level\nof fatigue and performance on memory and attention tests_ one wasnoted by Joyce et al_ _13_ _ Thus_ the direct effect of fatigue on cogni_\ntive performance in CFS remains unclear_ In another condition_ thepost_polio syndrome_ Ostlund et al_ _28_ also did not _nd a relation_\nship between general fatigue and cognitive de_cits_ Finally_ thereare multiple methodological dif_culties in the neuropsychologicalliterature on CFS_ for example_ heterogeneity in the diagnosis of CFSacross studies_ presence of comorbid depression_ and lack of controlgroups_\nIt is_ therefore_ dif_cult to clarify whether there are objective\ncognitive de_cits in patients with CFS_ particularly in terms of mem_ory and executive functions_ or whether the cognitive impairmentsare directly associated with the depressive symptoms in this con_dition_ Hence_ we evaluated as a primary objective_ the cognitiveperformance of patients with CFS using standardized verbal andvisual memory tests_ as well as sustained attention_ phasic alert_ness_ and the fatigue effect_ compared with a control group ofhealthy volunteers_ We investigated the same variables in a groupof patients with MDD_ Particular attention was paid to the evalua_tion of the quantitative dimension of depressive symptoms in thepatients with CFS_ Investigation of attention and memory functionswas chosen because these are the functions most often reportedas impaired in CFS but also in MDD_ Our primary hypothesis wasthat patients with CFS would have cognitive impairments that wereonly partially correlated with the depressive dimension of the con_dition_ suggesting that some cognitive impairments may be presentindependent of the depressive dimension_ The partial relationshipbetween cognitive and depressive symptomatology could be con__rmed by direct comparison with the MDD group_\nIn addition to these primary objectives_ we wanted to inves_\ntigate the possible gap between the subjective and objectivedimensions of cognition_ as some studies have reported moresubjective complaints than objective impairments_ Our secondaryobjectives were_ therefore_ to examine the subjects_ reactions tosuggestibility_ Some authors _29_ have argued that subjects with\nCFS are more suggestible than healthy persons using a measure ofgeneral suggestibility and the hypnotic induction pro_le _HIP_ _30_ _\nAnother way to approach this question would be to investigate taskinvolvement in order to exclude de_cit feigning and the attributionof cognitive de_cits to the possibility that CFS patients may be lessthan optimally motivated in the tasks _thus expending less effortbecause of a metacognitive belief of cognitive impairment__2_ Materials and methods\n2_1_ Subjects\nWe studied 25 patients with CFS_ 25 patients with MDD_\nand 25 healthy control subjects _see Table 1 for demographic\nparameters of these three groups__ All of the participants wereright_handed_ There was no signi_cant

i_e__ at\nleast six months of unexplained disabling fatigue _1_2_ _ CFS subjects\nwere recruited from the Referral Centre for CFS and MDD patientsfrom the outpatient psychiatric unit of the Cliniques UniversitairesSaint_Luc_ Brussels_ The healthy controls were recruited from thecare staff and volunteers of the Cliniques Universitaires Saint_Lucand from volunteer associations_ Before entering the study_ patientsand controls gave their informed consent to a protocol approved bythe Medical Ethics Committee of the School of Medicine of the Uni_versit_ catholique de Louvain_ The patients and the control subjectsunderwent a psychiatric interview supplemented by the StructuralClinical Interview for DSM_IV Axis I Disorders _SCID_ _31_ to con_rm\nthe diagnosis of unipolar major depressive episodes in the patientswith MDD and the absence of any Axis I psychiatric disorder inthe controls and the patients with CFS _in particular the absence ofMDD__ Exclusion criteria for the control subjects were unexplainedfatigue_ an organic condition that causes fatigue_ an unstable med_ical condition_ an organic brain disorder_ the use of psychotropicdrugs_ and a current or past mental disorder on the basis of theSCID I interview_\n2_2_ Procedure\n2_2_1_ Self_questionnaires\nSeveral scales were used to assess anxiety_ depression_ and\nfatigue_ The 40_item State Trait Anxiety Inventory Scale _STAI A_B _ _32_ assesses anxiety symptoms_ The _rst sub_scale indicates\nthe state of anxiety at the moment of the session _STAI_A__ thesecond sub_scale indicates the subject_s anxiety traits _STAI_B__The results are converted into T_scores_ A French version of the21_item Beck Depression Inventory _BDI_ _33_ assesses depression\nin adults _34_ _ The scores range from 0 to 63_ A score of 13 or\nless indicates a non_depressed state_ a score from 14 to 19 corre_sponds to _mildly depressed__ and a score over 20 indicates clinicaldepression_ The geriatric depression scale _GDS_ _35_ is a 30_item\ninstrument for assessing depression_ The value of this questionnaireis that physical symptoms are excluded_ whereas other instrumentsof depression assessment are too rich in somatic symptoms andtoo poor in cognitive symptoms_ Scores range from 0 to 30_ A scoreof 10 or less is considered to indicate the absence of depressivesymptoms_ and a score over 11 re_ects the presence of depressivesymptoms_ The fatigue severity scale _FSS_ _36_ is a 9_item scale\nassessing _disabling fatigue__ Total scores range from 9 to 63_ Thehigher the score_ the more the fatigue is disabling_E_L_ Constant et al_ _ Clinical Neurology and Neurosurgery 113 _2011_ 295_302 297\n2_2_2_ Cognitive tasks\nAttention was assessed with one computerized reaction time\ntest_ the Phasic Alertness Task of the TEA1_5 battery _37_ _ In this\ntask_ the subject is instructed to press a button as quickly as possibleas soon as a cross appears in the centre of the screen_ In one con_dition_ the cross is preceded by a warning signal _i_e__ a beep_ whilein the other condition there is no warning signal_ The median reac_tion time for correctly detected crosses is calculated for each of thetwo conditions _i_e__ with and without an audible warning signal__Phasic alertness re_ects optimization of the state of preparation orreactivity of a subject when the information he_she has to deal withis preceded by a signal warning of its imminent appearance_\nIn addition to this reaction time task_ two working memory tasks\nwere administered_ The _rst was the computerized working mem_ory task of the TEA1_5 battery _37_ where the subject has to press\non a button when a given stimulus _a digit which appears in thecentre of the screen_ is identical to a stimulus shown previously_the next to last digit shown on the screen__ A hundred digits from1 to 9 were presented in succession at 3_s inter_stimulus intervals_The median reaction time for correct responses and the numbersof correct responses and errors are recorded_ The second workingmemory task was the computerized paced auditory serial attentiontest _PASAT_ _38_ where single digits are presented auditorily_ Sub_\njects were instructed to add each new digit to the one immediatelyprior to it_ The test score is the total number of correct sums givenin each trial_\nFinally_ two episodic memory tasks _one verbal and the other\nvisual_ were also administered_ The verbal task was the word mem_ory test _WMT_ _39_ _ This computerized memory test measures the\nability to learn a list of 20 pairs of words displayed on the screen_e_g__ pig_bacon_ There are then six sub_tests_ immediate recogni_tion _IR__ delayed recognition _DR__ multiple choice _MC__ pairedassociates _PA__ free recall _FR__ and long delayed free recall _LDFR__Visual episodic memory was assessed using the _Doors test_ _40_ in\nwhich subjects are instructed to memorize two series of 12 picturesof doors _garage doors_ front doors_ etc___ Each door is shown for 3 sand then the subject is asked to recognize the door _target items_from a choice of four pictures of doors _score ranging between 0and 24__\n2_2_3_ Cognitive fatigue assessment\nIn addition to the subjective assessment of fatigue using the\nfatigue severity scale_ we assessed fatigue more objectively byadministering the phasic alertness part of the TEA again at theend of the testing session _which took approximately an hour anda half__ A fatigue index _total reaction times of Alertness test 2minus total reaction times of Alertness test 1_ was calculated andcompared among groups using an ANOVA_ A higher fatigue indexindicated a stronger effect of fatigue on phasic alertness_\n2_2_4_ Suggestibility and lack of effort _simulation_\nWe also added some tasks and_or indexes assessing suggestibil_\nity and lack of effort_ Suggestibility is de_ned as the tendency torespond to suggestions_ The effect of suggestibility was assessed bydividing the PASAT into two equal parts_ Half_way through the testthere was a pause_ and the investigator said_ _Now_ after this _rstpart of the test_ you probably feel a certain degree of fatigue_ whichwe will investigate before going on with the task__ The subject hadto assess his_her subjective fatigue on a 7_point Likert scale _fatigueseverity scale_ FSS_ ranging from _no fatigue_ to _extreme fatigue___A suggestibility index _total score of PASAT 2 minus total score ofPASAT 1_ was calculated and compared among the groups using anANOVA_ A higher negative index indicated a greater deteriorationof scores on PASAT 2 and thus a greater response to suggestibility_\nFor the assessment of simulation _or lack of effort__ we used\na speci_c task_ the Amsterdam Short Memory Test _short version__41_ _ This task comprises 45 items_ Each item involves the presenta_\ntion of _ve words from a common semantic category _e_g__ x_ y_ z_ w_v__ Subjects have to read the words aloud and memorize them_ Theyare then distracted with a simple addition or subtraction task_ Afterthis short interference task_ _ve words from the original seman_tic category are presented _e_g__ x_ y_ z_ a_ b__ Three words are thesame as in the previous trial_ and two are new and less frequent forthat category_ Subjects have to indicate which three words werepresent in the _rst series _no time limit__ The test score is the num_ber of correct responses_ the maximum score is 45 _3 points foreach 15 items__ In a preliminary study_ we showed that a cut_offscore of 40_45 _the lowest score obtained by a group of patientswith marked cerebral damage and severe amnesia_ was the bestthreshold to detect subjects asked to feign a memory de_cit _thesesubjects having a weaker score__\nIn addition to this speci_c task_ some index of simulation can\nalso be extracted from the WMT and the Doors tests_ Indeed_ IRand DR sub_tests from the WMT are particularly sensitive to lackof effort_ The consistency of the responses from IR to DR is calcu_lated_ This score allows investigation of lack of effort or simulation_The person receives a point if the correct response was chosen inthe two sub_tests or if the incorrect response was chosen in thetwo sub_tests and receives a score of zero if responses were incon_sistent for a given item_ scoring _correctly_ with some trials and_incorrectly_ with others_ The cut off score is _70__ Using this score_the performance of the subject can be questioned _42_ _ In the Doors\ntest_ the subject_s score is compared to chance performance_ Indeed_it is widely recognized that amnesic patients use implicit memory_or familiarity_ to recognize the target item_ and perform betterthan chance in most recognition tasks_ Hence_ if the subject_s per_formance is signi_cantly near to or less than that of chance _here25_ correct which is a score of 6_24__ the examiner may concludethat the examinee has intentionally chosen incorrect responses andmay have been motivated to perform inadequately _43_ _\n2_3_ Data analysis\nData were analyzed with Statistica 5_0_ The groups were com_\npared using a univariate analysis of variance _ANOVA__ The LSDtest or planned comparisons _post hoc comparisons_ were calcu_lated_ The statistical signi_cance for all of the analyses was set at__ _05_\n3_ Results\n3_1_ Depression_ anxiety and subjective fatigue\nFirst analyses of the questionnaires _see Table 2 _ showed a sig_\nni_cant main effect for each index_ Post hoc analysis suggested thatpatients with CFS were more depressed than controls on the BDIand GDS questionnaires_ but less depressed than the

Discussion\nIn this study_ we examined the performance of patients with CFS\nduring different cognitive tasks because there is still debate con_cerning the presence and interpretation of cognitive impairmentsin patients with CFS_ with some studies showing cognitive impair_ment and others not_ If there are cognitive de_cits in CFS patients_300 E_L_ Constant et al_ _ Clinical Neurology and Neurosurgery 113 _2011_ 295_302\nthe question is then to know whether these are core features of\nthe condition or an indirect consequence of other aspects of associ_ated comorbitities_ one of the most important being depression_ Inthis context_ the cognitive performances of patients with CFS werecompared with those of healthy controls_\nOur results clearly demonstrate cognitive impairment in\npatients with CFS and_ more importantly_ that it cannot beexplained by a lack of effort_ Indeed_ in terms of the subjects_involvement in the task_ we observed very good global perfor_mances not only for patients with MDD but also for those with CFS_Also_ importantly_ the cognitive impairments remained signi_cantafter the few patients who showed a lack of effort _ n_ 4 among a\ntotal of 50 patients_ were removed from our database_\nThe patients with CFS differed from the control group in several\naspects_ We observed that the patients with CFS were signi__cantly more anxious_ more depressed_ and more tired than thehealthy controls_ The overall results of the cognitive tests showedthat_ relative to healthy controls_ cognition was weaker among thepatients with CFS_ Analyses based on the group comparisons leadto the conclusion that the patients with CFS showed an impaired ormarkedly decreased ability to maintain attention and alertness_ Thepatients with CFS had slower phasic alertness_ They also showedimpairments in one working memory test _TEA_ and a tendency toimpairments in another _PASAT_ and in long_term memory _visualand verbal__ compared with the controls_\nHow can we interpret these cognitive impairments_ Are they\ndirectly linked to the pathophysiological mechanism of CFS or dothey re_ect an indirect consequence of the depressive symptomsoften observed in this condition_ Two arguments suggest that thecognitive de_cits in CFS are core symptoms of the condition and arenot the consequence of the depression dimension of the disorder_First_ when we compared the performances of patients with CFS andthose with MDD_ there were several differences_ the patients withCFS were signi_cantly less anxious and less depressed_ but morefatigued than the patients with MDD_ These results are in line withother papers_ Using the BDI_ Short et al_ _25_ and DeLuca et al_ _44_\nreported that subjects with CFS were more depressed than con_trols_ Cope et al_ _3_ and DeLuca et al_ _10_ _ on the other hand_ found\nthat subjects with CFS were less depressed than depressed patients_Using the STAI_ Riccio et al_ _8_and Cope et al_ _3_reported that there\nwere no differences between patients with CFS and controls_ How_ever_ DeLuca et al_ _10_ found that patients with CFS were more\nanxious than controls but less anxious than depressed subjects_similar to the results of the present study_ Finally_ the literaturealso reports that subjects with CFS are more tired than controls_44_45_ and more tired than depressed subjects _10_ _ For the cog_\nnitive tests_ patients with CFS and those with MDD also differed inseveral aspects_ There were three differences for the reaction timeand accuracy measures we used_ the patients with CFS were slowerin the TEA working memory test and obtained a better accuracyscore on the PASAT test than the patients with MDD_ It is also veryinteresting to note that patients with CFS were more impaired onthe long delay free recall of the WMT than patients with MDD_ Thisindex is probably the most sensitive for the detection of memorydif_culties_\nThe second argument for considering that cognitive de_cits\nare core symptoms of CFS comes from the correlation analyses_Although_ as expected_ cognitive impairments in patients with MDDwere strongly associated with depression and subjective fatigue_ inpatients with CFS we only observed_ _1_ a weak correlation betweenworking memory index and depression_ _2_ no correlation at allfor the other cognitive dimensions and depression_ and _3_ no cor_relation between cognitive measures and subjective fatigue_ Ourresults are in line with those of several authors _3_5_13_15_22_25_\nwho have shown that symptoms of depression do not correlate sig_ni_cantly with a variety of neuropsychological measures_ althoughother studies _6_7_11_17_21_ have reported such a correlation_ As\ndiscussed by others _23_ _ the fact that_ in this study_ MDD and CFS\npatients differed in several aspects is not surprising_ From a neu_robiological point of view_ there are also differences_ hypoactivityof the hypothalamic_pituitary_adrenal axis is usually observed inCFS_ in contrast to the hyperactivity of this axis in MDD _46_48_ _\nInterestingly_ in an atypical subtype of MDD _with hypersomnia_leaden paralysis_ mood reactivity_ interpersonal rejection sensitiv_ity__ hypoactivity of this axis is also observed _46_47_ _\nOur results show that globally the patients with CFS were no\nmore sensitive to suggestibility than the other two groups and_ infact_ were less suggestible than the patients with MDD_ Our resultsdo not replicate the _ndings of DiClementi et al_ _29_ _ who observed\nthat patients with CFS were more suggestible than controls on ameasure of general suggestibility _recall task of history_ and on thehypnotic induction pro_le _HIP_ _30_ _ The HIP is a brief structured\ntechnique that measures behavioural_ perceptual_ and cognitiveresponses to suggestions_ Subjects are asked to perform an eyeroll and then_ once their eyelids are closed_ the hypnotic inductioninvolves suggestions by the examiner of _oating and arm levita_tion_ In that study_ induction scores for the CFS group were higherthan those for controls_ It is important here to specify that sug_gestibility is not synonymous with gullibility_ Suggestibility refersto a type of information processing that is selective and distortedin that relevant information cannot be handled in a balanced fash_ion_ According to DiClementi et al_ _29_ _ _suggestible persons with\nCFS do experience the symptoms they report_ However_ a tendencyto focus on symptoms_ perhaps to the exclusion of other infor_mation_ may be related to CFS patients_ dif_culties in processingcomplex cognitive information_ and dif_culties with divided atten_tion_ _pp_ 684_685__ In line with this argument_ it is important tonote that although_ in our study_ patients with CFS were not moresuggestible than the two other groups_ there was a positive corre_lation between length of illness and the suggestibility index_ Thismay mean that the longer the CFS illness_ the more patients focuson their symptoms and if someone else focuses their attention ontheir symptoms_ they will show a greater response to that sugges_tion and this process will impair the realization of the cognitivetask in which they are involved_\nAs regards the impact of fatigue_ there were no signi_cant dif_\nferences among the three groups on the fatigue index_ These resultsare in line with the observations of most other authors _5_6_25_27_\nwho found no relationship between the level of fatigue in patientswith CFS and their performance on cognitive tests_ However_ Joyceet al_ _13_ did _nd one relationship between these parameters_\nIt is interesting to note that in another condition_ the post_poliosyndrome_ Ostlund et al_ _28_ also found no relationship between\ngeneral fatigue and cognitive de_cits_ However_ it is important toremember that the fact that we did not observe a direct effectof fatigue on cognitive variables does not mean that_ at the brainlevel_ the mental fatigue induced by our task did not have differ_ent consequences on brain activity in our three study populations_In a functional neuroimaging study_ Cook et al_ _49_ observed that_\ncompared with normal controls_ patients with CFS did not differin _nger tapping or auditory monitoring tasks _PASAT__ but exhib_ited signi_cantly greater activity in several cortical and subcorticalregions during the fatiguing cognitive task _PASAT__ In particular_compared to controls_ patients with CFS exhibited greater utiliza_tion of brain regions within the working memory system in orderto successfully complete the PASAT_ These results_ therefore_ sug_gest an association between subjective feelings of mental fatigueand brain responses during a fatiguing cognition_ Moreover_ thefact that_ in this study_ the objective effect of fatigue on cognitionwas not larger than in the two other groups does not mean that thesubjective impression of fatigue would not be higher in patientswith CFS_ Grafman et al_ _5_ investigated the relationship betweenE_L_ Constant et al_ _ Clinical Neurology and Neurosurgery 113 _2011_ 295_302 301\nthe subjective memory complaints of patients with CFS and their\nlevel of fatigue and found that there was evidence of a positiverelationship_\nFinally_ the present study has methodological issues that need to\nbe addressed_ First_ the MDD group did not strictly match the othergroups in years of education_ However_ we believe that this cannotexplain the results observed in the cognitive tests_ After adjustingfor years of education as covariates_ we observed the same resultsin the different cognitive tests_ Second_ maximum age in the CFSgroup was 55_ in the MDD group 68_ and in the control group 64_Especially for the MDD and control group there were some olderpersons included_ We know that aging has also a deteriorating effecton cognitive functioning although we do not think it would haveimpacted substantially the current outcomes_ Third_ the patientswith MDD were typically outpatients without atypical depressionor melancholic depression_ so the results of the present study can_not be extended to all types of patients with MDD_ Moreover_ itcould have been their _rst major depressive episode or a recur_rent one_ Some may argue that patients with recurrent depressiveepisodes are more at risk of cognitive impairments_ Fourth_ we usedtwo self_administered questionnaires _BDI and GDS_ to investigatedepression and not the Hamilton depression rating scale _HDRS_administered by a clinician_ Some may argue that subjectivity ismore often re_ected in the BDI scores than in the HDRS_ We choseto use self_administered questionnaires because two psychologistsparticipated in the evaluation of the patients and we wanted toavoid interjudge variability_ Moreover_ in the GDS_ physical symp_toms are excluded_ which is important for the assessment of thedepressive dimension in patients with CFS_ Fifth_ although the con_trols were not included if they were taking psychotropic drugs_ thiswas not the case for the patients with MDD or CFS_ and psychotropicdrugs may in_uence cognition_ Nevertheless_ it is almost impossibleto conduct such a study in drug naive patients and we can argue thatour patients are at least highly representative of patients seen indaily practice_ Finally_ it would have been interesting to investigatethe suggestibility and fatigue dimensions with more than one cog_nitive test_ It would have been interesting also to investigate othertypes of executive functions_ Future research in this _eld shouldalso compare cognition in subgroups with similar neurobiological_ndings_ for example_ patients with atypical MDD or CFS_\nIn conclusion_ the present study con_rms the presence of objec_\ntive impairment in attention and memory in patients with CFSbut with good mobilization of effort and without exaggerated sug_gestibility_\nFunding\nNo _nancial support was received for the work_\nCon_icts of interest\nThere are no con_icts of

research has shown that rumination aggravates nega_tive mood_ Moreover_ rumination has been identified as a core risk factor for depression with serious clinical im_plications due to more depressed mood_ longer depres_sive episodes and the occurrence of future depressive ep_isodes  \n_7_10_  _ Recent studies indicate that depressive ru_\nmination is connected to cognitive impairments in MDD_ It is discussed as an important underlying cognitive mechanism_ However_ there is little understanding of the extent to which rumination influences cognitive perfor_mance_ especially in single domains_\n  Rumination and Cognitive Impairments  \n Resource allocation theory posits that rumination ab_\nsorbs cognitive capacities which can thus not be directed towards task_relevant processes  \n_11_13_  _ According to \nthis theory_ valuable cognitive resources are allocated to irrelevant depressive and ruminative thought processes_ Indeed_ there are many findings that support the link be_tween reduced cognitive performance and rumination as put forward in the dual_process model of cognitive vul_nerability in depressed persons_ According to this model_ the ability of depressed individuals to implement correc_tive reflective processing in order to overcome automatic negative biases is impaired_ because this processing re_quires effort and cognitive resources that are not available  \n_14_ _ Thus_ rumination might reduce  cognitive flexibility   \nand raise interference levels above a critical threshold_ In line with these results_ Davis and Nolen_Hoeksema  \n_15_  \nshowed that participants who scored high on a self_report measure of ruminative style made more perseverative er_rors than nonruminators in the Wisconsin card sorting test_ a widely used measure of  executive control   and  cogni_\ntive flexibility  _\n  In addition_ the dual_process model posits that the \ncognitive resources of depressed individuals might al_ready be strained by competing mood_congruent and ru_minative thought processes  \n_14_ _ In particular the brood_\ning_ maladaptive component of rumination has been found to be associated with higher negative  attentional \nbiases    \n_16_ _ suggesting that depressed individuals with \nhigh levels of brooding have tightly connected negative schemata from which they have difficulty in breaking away_ Some scholars_ on the other hand_ have related ru_mination to major deficits in  cognitive control  _ regardless \nof the valence of the processed material_ Specifically_ ru_minators are thought to exhibit an impaired ability to flexibly shift  attention   or  inhibit  irrelevant information \n_e_g_  \n15 _  17 __  Previous research has also reported that rumination is \nrelated to  memory deficits   and  memory biases   _18_ 19_  _ For \nexample_ when people are asked to recall memories of specific autobiographical events_ depressed patients are more likely to retrieve overgeneral_ categorical memories that are summaries of repeated occasions than controls _for a review_ see  \n20 __ Watkins et al_  _21_  found that the \ndistraction induction _as a composite of rumination in_duction_ significantly reduced overgeneral memory at preinduction levels_ \n  Rumination has also been associated with  working \nmemory   deficits_ Joormann and Gotlib  \n_22_  proved a link \nbetween rumination_ impaired  working memory_   and de_\npression_ They found that the interference of negative ir_relevant words was correlated with self_reported rumina_tion_ This relation with rumination was limited to the MDD group and remained significant even after partial_ing out the level of depressive symptomatology_ the high_er the participants_ scored for the self_reported measure of rumination_ the greater their difficulty in removing task_irrelevant negative content from their working memory_ The connection between rumination and im_paired working memory was also reported by other au_thors  \n_23_ 24_  _\n  There have also been several experimental research \nstudies on the effect of induced rumination on  executive \nfunctions   _e_g_  25_27  __ In the study by Watkins and Brown \n _13_ _ for example_ the performance of depressed patients \nand nondepressed controls was compared for a random number generation task_ performed after either a rumina_tion or a distraction induction_ Compared with the dis_traction induction_ the rumination induction produced a significant increase in stereotyped counting responses _reflecting a failure of inhibitory executive control_ in de_pressed patients but not in controls_ However_ after dis_traction_ no difference was found between the 2 groups_ The authors concluded that the rumination induction may interfere with concurrent executive processing_\n  In sum_ findings from the studies reviewed above ten_\ntatively support a connection between rumination and deficits in cognitive performance_ However_ previous re_search on the impact of rumination on

rumination on different cognitive domains in MDD is still very limited_\n  Furthermore_ many studies on rumination and cogni_\ntive dysfunctions have not controlled for the influence of other factors such as the severity of depression_ the amount of depressive episodes in the past_ medication or duration of the current episode_ Previous research has shown that these factors can strongly influence the extent of cognitive deficits in MDD  \n_28_ _ Moreover_ it seems es_\nsential to control for general factors such as age_ patients_ intelligence_ or level of education  \n_29_ _ However_ these \nfactors have not been taken into consideration so far_ \n  Previous investigations have also failed to explore the \nrelationship between rumination in everyday life and cognitive performance_ Most studies have assessed the in_fluence of rumination in an experimental design_ which required participants to complete several cognitive tasks after introducing rumination_ Therefore_ it stands to rea_son that rumination induced shortly before examination has an impact on the ability to solve cognitive tasks_ How_ever_ it is unclear as to whether depressive patients who ruminate a lot about themselves and their diseases in ev_eryday life also exhibit higher cognitive impairments than depressive patients whose tendency to ruminate in every_day life is not as pronounced_\n  The current study aims at answering the above_men_\ntioned questions_ thus closing a gap in research by sys_tematically analyzing the relationship between assessed everyday_life rumination and different cognitive func_tions in MDD by controlling for as many influencing fac_tors as possible_ Based on previous research_ we hypoth_esize that the severity of cognitive deficits in MDD is re_lated to ruminative

impairments in MDD besides rumination_ \n  Our results indicate that cognitive impairments in \nMDD are linked to rumination in the domain of process_ing speed_ This was the only cognitive domain that was influenced by rumination after including other predic_tors in the hierarchical regression analysis_ To our knowl_edge_ there has been no previous research on the impact of rumination on processing speed_ This is_ however_ a basic cognitive domain which affects cognitive perfor_mance in general_ In line with these results_ previous stud_ies have suggested that cognitive impairments in depres_sion may be mediated in part or wholly by more basic deficits such as processing speed _e_g_  \n37_39  __ These stud_\nies did not_ however_ examine the influence of rumination in this context_ It seems that rumination could be an un_derlying mechanism for the connection between process_ing speed and cognitive impairments in MDD_ Further research is needed to assess this relationship and to gen_eralize the findings if possible_\n  Furthermore_ our findings are partially consistent with \nthe results of Davis and Nolen_Hoeksema  \n_15_ _ who ex_\namined the influence of self_reported rumination on ex_ecutive functions_ especially on executive control and cognitive flexibility_ In their study_ high ruminators made more preservative errors than nonruminators_ In line with this finding high_ruminating MDD patients of the current study reached a lower score in the executive do_main _indicating greater deficits_ than low ruminators_ The decreasing influence of rumination on the executive domain score in further calculations may be due to the fact that the range between high and low rumination in the current study is smaller than between the high and nonruminators in Davis and Nolen_Hoeksema_s  \n_15_  in_\nvestigation_\n  In contrast to previous reports from experimental \nstudies_ which showed an association between rumina_tion and attentional deficits _e_g_  \n16 _  22 __ we found no \nsignificant difference between the 2 rumination groups in our analysis_ Furthermore_ our study does not support the existence of a link between rumination and memory def_icits as well as working memory deficits found by other researchers _e_g_  \n23 _  24 __ In this context the findings of \nTeasdale et al_  _40_  and Antrobus  _41_  have to be taken \ninto consideration_ They observed that increasing the cognitive demands of the current external task led to a reduction in the frequency of off_task thoughts_ resulting in an improvement in task performance_ These results suggest that attention_demanding tasks may disrupt ru_mination_ In the current study_ we observed rumination \nin the everyday life of patients_ with no rumination induc_tion_ For this reason_ one could argue that a 1_h neuro_psychological examination already constitutes an in_creased cognitive demand_ which interrupts rumination_ In this brief period of time_ participants of our study may exhibit a relative improvement in their cognitive perfor_mance compared to their performance in everyday life_\n  Another important point should be taken into consid_\neration when interpreting the results concerning the in_fluence of rumination on memory_ Based on evidence from _choking under pressure_  \n_42_ 43_  _ it is plausible to \nassume that rumination as a predominantly verbal phe_nomenon mainly absorbs verbal capacities_ Using a vi_sual but not a verbal memory test may cause less interfer_ence with rumination and therefore mask possible rela_tionships between rumination and memory_ This fact may Iimit the interpretations to a nonsignificant relation_ship between rumination and visual memory_ although there is a nonsignificant relationship between rumination and verbal working memory_\n  To our knowledge_ the present investigation is the first \nthat has attempted to systematically determine the impact of rumination on cognitive impairments in MDD in a broad range of cognitive domains_ A differentiated stan_dardization was available for each domain_ Another im_portant difference between the current study and the ma_jority of previous studies is the absence of induced rumi_nation_ Typically_ participants are induced to ruminate or distract from rumination_ before being asked to complete cognitive tasks_ These rumination and distraction induc_tions may produce stronger differences in cognitive per_formance in the laboratory compared to selecting par_ticipants based on their RSQ_D score_ \n  However_ there are some limitations to this study that \nshould be addressed in future research_ The first limita_tion is due to the outpatient MDD sample_ Only 3 of 21 patients of the high_rumination group were male_ There_fore_ no conclusions can be drawn about the influence of gender_ Furthermore_ the variance of rumination scores in this sample was restricted_ therefore_ our results might underestimate the association between rumination and cognitive deficits_ Further research should extend the sample in addition to inpatients and healthy controls_ Secondly_ one could argue that the lack of impact of ru_mination on some cognitive domains is due to the com_puting of the neuropsychological variables_ Our cognitive performance parameters were computed by combining the test scores into a single index of specific cognitive do_mains_ The score of the attention domain demonstrated Downloaded from http___karger_com_psp_article_pdf_50_5_347_3492414_000478785_pdf by UNC Chapel Hill user on 09

third problem concerns the unequal distribution of partici_pants_ The group of low ruminators was almost twice as large as that of the high ruminators_ This restricted only the mean value analyses on

relationship between rumination and cognitive impairments in MDD_ Due to the limitations mentioned above_ it is important to verify whether our results can be generalized_\n  The current findings offer new insights into the fre_\nquently observed link between rumination and cognitive impairments in MDD_ We have proved that patients who tend to ruminate in everyday life only show limitations in processing speed_ but not a general reduction in their cog_nitive performance_ For a limited period of time they can exhibit the cognitive performance comparable to that of low ruminators_ Inpatients and healthy controls should be included in the samples of subsequent studies to enable \ngeneralization of this study_s findings_ Another question unanswered by this study concerns the point in time at which attention starts to tilt and provide space for rumi_nation under conditions of increasing cognitive demands_ These prevailing ruminating thoughts can occupy cogni_tive resources and lead to a decreased cognitive perfor_mance_ as shown in many experimental studies_ This question is highly relevant in everyday life and highlights the necessity for further investigations_\n Acknowledgments

functioning and working memory associated with frontal lobe dysfunction are prominent in depression\nand work_related long_term sick leave _LTSL__ This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging _fMRI_ to investigate\npotential differences in brain activation patterns in these conditions_ In addition_ the function of the hypothalamic_pituitary_adrenal _HPA_ axis was examined and compared between groups_ Since there is a clear overrepresentation of women in thesediagnostic groups_ and to ensure a more homogenous sample population_ only women were included_ To examine the neural\ncorrelates of relevant cognitive processes in patients on sick leave _90 days due to work_related LTSL_ recently diagnosed\npatients with major depression Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders_ Fourth Edition _DSM_IV criteria_untreated__ and healthy controls _ n_10_ each group__ a 2_back working memory task and a visual long_term memory task\nwere administered during fMRI scanning_ HPA axis functioning was investigated using a diurnal curve of saliva cortisol and a\ndexamethasone suppression test_ Task performance was comparable among the three groups_ Multivariate image analysisrevealed that both memory tasks engaged a similar brain network in all three groups_ including the prefrontal and parietalcortex_ During the 2_back task_ LTSL patients had signi_cant frontal hypoactivation compared to controls and patients with\ndepression_ Saliva cortisol measurements showed a _attening of the diurnal rythmicity in LTSL patients compared to patients\nwith depression and healthy contols_ Taken together_ these _ndings indicate that work stress_related LTSL and majordepression are dissociable in terms of frontal activation and diurnal cortisol rhythmicity_\nKeywords_ Cognition_ fMRI_ HPA axis_ multivariate_ prefrontal_ stress\nIntroduction\nStress has emerged as an important factor in\npsychiatric diagnoses_ A dysregulation of stresssystems

stress as the main causeof disease _The Swedish National Social InsuranceBoard 2003__\nResearch efforts in the _eld of work_related stress are\ncomplicated by the lack of consensus about diagnostic\ncriteria_ Depression is the category of use in the _eld ofstress_related disorders_ despite the fact that severalscienti_c papers indicate that depression and work_related stress do not share patterns of physiological andpsychological changes _Rydmark et al_ 2006_ Wahlberget al_ 2009__ The concept of burnout is initially adescription of the frustration and emotional detach_ment seen in social and health workers _Mason 1975_Maslach et al_ 2001__ Originally_ the term was not\nmeant as a classi_cation of disease_ but rather a\ndescription of the process of exhaustion or adaptationto

code _i_e_ exhaustion syndrome F43_8_ toclassify the closely related terms_ clinical burnout_ vitalexhaustion_ and mental fatigue_ As proposed byA _sberg\nand co_workers_ burnout should not be considered a\nnecessary or suf_cient condition for developing stress_\nrelated disease_ Rather_ it is a process or coping strategyto endure challenging situations at work that may leadto disease or exhaustion syndrome _Asberg et al_ 2010__Since there is no international consensus on this issue_we have used the term work_related LTSL in this study_\nThe symptoms of individuals on work_related LTSL\noverlap with core symptoms of major depression_Wahlberg et al_ 2009__ which has prompted examin_ations of whether individuals on LTSL due to work\nstress and patients with major depression share HPA\naxis pathophysiology _Rydmark et al_ 2006__ Thoughmajor depression has been associated with up_regulated reactivity of the HPA axis_ patients withstress were found to exhibit a marked decrease in thereactivity of the HPA axis _Wahlberg et al_ 2009__ In thesame study_ no support was obtained for a reduction inhippocampal volume_ and cognitive impairment wasmore indicative of a disruption of the frontocorticalsystem rather than hippocampus dysfunction_ We and\nothers have reported a similar pattern of neurocogni_\ntive alterations in stressed patients_ with evidence offrontal cognitive de_cits _Sandstrom et al_ 2005_ andintact hippocampal volume _Sandstrom et al_ 2011__In contrast_ major depression has repeatedly been\nassociated with lowered performance on hippocampal_dependent explicit_episodic memory tasks _Airaksinenet al_ 2004_ and reduced hippocampal volume_Videbech and Ravnkilde 2004__\nCollectively_ these _ndings suggest differences\nbetween major depression and chronic stress_ Inparticular_ individuals on LTSL due to work stresstend to exhibit frontal_ rather than hippocampal_dysfunction_ This view is in line with a notion of thestress_brain link that implicates many cortical andsubcortical regions other than the hippocampus_including the frontal cortex _Lupien and Lepage2001__ Converging evidence indicates that not only\naffective but also cognitive regions in the frontal lobes\nare dysfunctional in major depression _Steele et al_2007__ and patients suffering from major depressionexhibit a pattern of cognitive dysfunction that extendsbeyond the domain of explicit_episodic memory toexecutive_ frontal lobe_sensitive tasks _Stordal et al_2004_ Dahlin et al_ 2008__ Furthermore_ imagingstudies have suggested an increased activity in thesubgenual anterior cingulate cortex _sACC_ inpatients with depression_ which is decreased by\nsuccessful treatment _Mayberg et al_ 2003_ 2005__\nDirect_ within_study_ comparisons of patients on\nLTSL due to work stress and patients with majordepression are critical for addressing the questions ofwhether these two categories re_ect a shared or distinctpathophysiology_ To date_ such studies are rare and_ tothe best of our knowledge_ no prior study hascompared the functional brain responses of patientsfrom each category while engaged in memory tasks_\nThe main objective of this study was to compare\nfunctional magnetic resonance imaging _fMRI_\npatterns and diurnal cortisol across three groups__i_ controls_ _ii_ acute unmedicated patients withunipolar major depression_

patterns and diurnalcortisol between acute unmedicated patients withunipolar major depression and patients on LTSL dueto work stress_ Of main interest was to examinewhether LTSL patients under_recruited parts offrontal cortex during cognitive processing_\nThe fMRI results showed pronounced similarities in\nactivation patterns across the groups_ suggestinglargely intact functional networks_ This was furthersubstantiated by intact cognitive performance_However_ during the more demanding cognitive task_n_back__ the LTSL subjects showed a reduction\nin prefrontal cortex activation_ Speci_cally_ a groupdifference was observed in the right dorsolateraland left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex_ In addition_response times during n_back correlated with brain\nactivity for controls and depressed patients but not forthe LTSL subjects_ who tended to have a slowerresponse_ This pattern of slowed response andreduced frontal activity in patients with stress disorderis consistent with previous _ndings that patients withstress exhibit reduced performance on cognitivelydemanding tasks that are assumed to re_ect theintegrity of frontal lobe functioning _Rydmark et al_\n2006_ Ohman et al_ 2007_ Sandstrom et al_ 2011__\nIn particular_ the _ndings from the brain_cognitioncorrelation analysis are indicative of alterations offunctional working memory networks in LTSLpatients_ Still_ as this observation was found in amore exploratory analysis and was based on arelatively small group of patients_ further generali_zations must await future replication_\nMore generally_ the present _ndings are in line with\nthe view that the frontal cortex may be as critical as thehippocampus when it comes to the regulation ofstress _Lupien et al_ 2009__ Notably_ this is a dualrelationship_ as the medial prefrontal cortex as well asthe hippocampus may be an important target forglucocorticoid actions _Herman et al_ 2005__ Indeed_a recent study has shown that chronic stress or chronicadministration of glucocorticoids produces dendriticremodeling in prefrontal pyramidal neurons _Martin\nand Wellman 2011__\nThe diurnal saliva cortisol curve for the LTSL\npatients showed a trend toward _attening with highercortisol levels at 11_00 h_ whereas controls anddepressed patients had similar diurnal patterns_ Itremains to be determined if a blunted diurnal
