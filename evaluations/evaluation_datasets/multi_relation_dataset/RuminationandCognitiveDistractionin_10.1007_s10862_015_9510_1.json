    "PaperContents": "Abstract\nDifficulty regulating emotions following stressful events is a hallmark of Major Depressive Disorder _MDD__ Although individuals_ ability to regulate their emotions is believed to have direct consequences for both emotional and physical wellbeing_ few studies have examined the cardiovascular effects of different emotion regulation strategies in MDD_ To the best of our knowledge_ the current study is the first to examine the effects of two emotion regulation strategies_ cognitive distraction and rumination_ on both self_reported sadness and respiratory sinus arrhythmia _RSA_ in individuals with MDD and healthy controls _CTLs__ Following a forced_failure stressor_ participants were randomly assigned to a rumination or cognitive distraction condition_ As expected_ rumination increased sadness and triggered RSA withdrawal for both MDDs and CTLs_ Interestingly_ although cognitive distraction reduced sadness_ it also triggered RSA withdrawal_ Moreover_ cognitive distraction was associated with greater RSA withdrawal for MDDs than CTLs_ Thus_ although depressed individuals are able to use cognitive distraction to emotionally recover from stress_ it may be associated with greater cognitive effort_ Adding low_cost physiological measures such as RSA into assessments has the potential to offer new and important information about the effects of emotion regulation on mental and physiological health_\n\nKeywords_ depression_ stress_ emotion regulation_ respiratory sinus arrhythmia_ autonomic nervous system\nExaggerated emotional and cardiovascular responses to stress are central characteristics of Major Depressive Disorder _MDD_ e_g__ Brown _ Harris_ 1986_ Lazarus _ Folkman_ 1984_ Monroe _ Hadjiyannakis_ 2002__ and can have detrimental effects on mental and physical wellbeing _for a review see Grippo _ Johnson_ 2009__ In fact_ an altered response to stress is a primary pathophysiological mechanism linking MDD to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality_ Although past research has focused on individual differences in the initial reactivity to stress_ studies increasingly emphasize the importance of examining individuals_ ability to regulate their emotions after the stressor ends _Flynn _ Rudolph_ 2007_ Nolen_Hoeksema_ Wisco_ _ Lyubomirsky_ 2008__ For example_ models of stress and health posit that emotion regulation strategies are critical determinants of emotional and cardiovascular health_ particularly for those with psychopathology _Brosschot_ Gerin_ _ Thayer_ 2006_ Kubzansky_ Davidson_ _ Rozanski_ 2005__ Despite this_ little is known about the effects of using different emotion regulation strategies on cardiovascular activity in MDD_\n\nThe parasympathetic nervous system plays an important role in regulating cardiovascular activity_ More specifically_ the parasympathetic nervous system influences oscillations in heart rate via its effect on the vagus nerve_ which affects heart rate acceleration and deceleration during respiration_ Whereas vagal activity is temporarily suppressed during inhalation_ causing heart rate to increase_ vagal activity resumes during exhalation_ causing heart rate to decrease_ Greater parasympathetic input leads to greater heart rate acceleration after inhalation and greater heart rate deceleration after exhalation_ Thus_ greater parasympathetic activity is associated with greater variability in the interval between heartbeats_ Respiratory sinus arrhythmia _RSA_ has been identified as an optimal marker of this beat_to_beat variation in heart rate linked to the respiratory cycle_ RSA offers advantages over other measures of the parasympathetic nervous system _e_g__ low_frequency heart rate variability_ given that it is unconfounded by sympathetic activation _Berntson_ Cacioppo_ _ Quigley_ 1993__ RSA also has advantages over other measures of biological functioning_ For one_ RSA is relatively inexpensive in that the per subject cost of data collection is minimal_ RSA data collection is also far less invasive than other methods for collecting biological data_ In fact_ with the development of technology to collect ambulatory RSA_ it is increasingly feasible to measure RSA data in applied research and clinical settings with minimal or no disruption to the individual _Cullins et al__ 2013_ Goedhart_ de Vries_ Kreft_ Bakker_ _ de Geus_ 2008_ Grossman_ Wilhelm_ _ Spoerle_ 2004__\n\nGiven the advantages of collecting RSA data_ it is not surprising that RSA is used frequently to index parasympathetic activity _see Berntson_ Cacioppo_ _ Grossman_ 2007_ for an overview__ Parasympathetic activity_ and thus RSA_ is high during times of rest_ when energy expenditure is actively reduced _e_g__ by inhibiting the sympathetic innervations of the heart_ Lovallo _ Thomas_ 2000_ Rottenberg_ 2007__ However_ when environmental demands become more challenging_ such as in a time of stress_ this _brake_ _Rottenberg_ 2007_ is rapidly withdrawn in order to meet environmental demands_ Thus_ adaptive parasympathetic responses to stress trigger moderate RSA withdrawal _Blair _ Peters_ 2003_ Kreibig_ 2010__ RSA withdrawal allows autonomic changes that prime the body for action and facilitate responses to environmental changes_ including better executive functioning and social competence _Blair _ Peters_ 2003_ Marcovitch et al__ 2010__ In contrast to adaptive physiological responses to stress_ exaggerated reactivity or delayed recovery _evidenced by greater or longer RSA withdrawal_ places the body under excessive strain and increases risk for cardiovascular and other organic diseases _Crowell_ Skidmore_ Rau _ Williams_ 2013__ To facilitate recovery_ the body activates the parasympathetic nervous system_ leading to increased RSA_ Individual differences in the use of emotion regulation strategies may be associated with different amounts of parasympathetic activation_ and these differences may be particularly relevant for individuals with MDD_ who are at greater risk for poor health outcomes_ including cardiovascular disease _Keicolt_Gaser _ Glaser_ 2002__\n\nPast research on emotion regulation and recovery from stress in MDD focuses largely on self_reported sadness_ Whereas adaptive emotion regulation strategies facilitate recovery from stress_ maladaptive emotion regulation strategies prolong depressed mood_ Distraction is typically considered an adaptive emotion regulation strategy in the short_term given that it decreases sadness and facilitates engagement in behaviors that are likely to further improve mood _Donaldson _ Lam_ 2004_ Watkins_ Teasdale_ _ Williams_ 2000__ Both healthy controls and individuals with MDD are able to effectively down_regulate negative emotions when exposed to a distraction induction _for a review see Nolen_Hoeksema et al__ 2008__ Unlike healthy controls_ however_ individuals with MDD do not often spontaneously engage in distraction in everyday life_ This may be due_ in part_ to the fact that it is difficult for depressed individuals to disengage from negative thoughts_ resulting in an unproductive pattern of ruminative thinking _Joormann_ 2010_ Nolen_Hoeksema_ Morrow_ _ Fredrickson_ 1993__ The response styles theory _Nolen_Hoeksema_ 1991_ Nolen_Hoeksema et al__ 2008_ defines rumination as repeatedly thinking about negative feelings and the potential antecedents or repercussions of those feelings_ In contrast to distraction_ ruminative responses to stress increase the duration and severity of depressed moods _Nolen_Hoeksema et al__ 1993__\n\nAlthough the emotional consequences of rumination and distraction have been well established _see Lyubomirsky _ Tkach_ 2004_ and Nolen_Hoeksema et al__ 2008_ for reviews__ less is known about the effects of these emotion regulation strategies on RSA_ Initial evidence indicates that both anger and depressive rumination are associated with parasympathetic withdrawal _Key_ Campbell_ Bacon_ _ Gerin_ 2008_ Ottaviani_ Shapiro_ Davydov_ Goldstein_ _ Mills_ 2009__ whereas distraction is associated with parasympathetic activation _Gerin_ Davidson_ Christenfeld_ Goyal_ _ Schwartz_ 2006_ Ottaviani et al__ 2009_ Ottaviani et al__ 2011__ The majority of studies use passive distraction tasks_ which involve passively viewing neutral movies or images _Gerin et al__ 2006_ or overhearing a fabricated phone conversation _Ottaviani et al__ 2009_ 2011__ By contrast_ other studies use cognitive distraction tasks_ which require greater cognitive control and demand_ Cognitive distraction has been shown to be effective at improving negative mood _Eisenberg _ Morris_ 2003_ Eisenberg_ Morris_ _ Spinrad_ 2008__ The effect of cognitive distraction on parasympathetic activity_ however_ is more uncertain and has not been examined in MDD_\n\nThe primary goal of the current study was to compare clinically depressed and healthy control participants_ parasympathetic activity during a rumination and cognitive distraction induction_ In the process_ we hoped to demonstrate the importance and feasibility of adding physiological measures to assessments of emotion regulation_ In this study_ participants were exposed to a forced_failure stressor_ selected for its ability both to induce sad mood _Hammen_ 2005_ and to trigger biological changes _Kirschbaum_ Pirke_ _ Hellhammer_ 1993__ Following the forced_failure task_ participants were randomly assigned either to ruminate on their poor performance or to cognitively distract themselves from it_ We measured RSA reactivity before and during the forced_failure and emotion regulation periods_ Whereas we expected rumination to be associated with RSA withdrawal in both the MDD and control groups_ we expected cognitive distraction to be associated with RSA activation in both groups_\n\nMethod\nParticipants\nInclusion and exclusion criteria for the current study were determined via an in_person Structured Clinical Interview for DSM_IV _SCID_ First_ Spitzer_ Gibbon_ _ Williams_ 2002__ which was conducted by trained graduate students_ Strong inter_rater reliability was established_ _ _ 1_00_ Participants were included if they were between the ages of 18 and 60 and were in one of two groups_ those who met criteria for current major depressive disorder _MDD_ n _ 47__ and those who did not meet criteria for any past or current Axis I disorder _Control_ CTL_ n _ 51__ Participants were excluded due to severe head trauma_ learning disabilities_ bipolar disorder_ psychotic symptoms_ alcohol or substance abuse within the past six months_ or medical conditions that would affect psychophysiological recordings _e_g__ heart murmur__ Data from 7 participants with MDD and 4 CTLs could not be included due to excessive movement artefacts or signal error_ Thus_ the final sample included 40 participants in the MDD group and 47 in the CTL group_\n\nForced_Failure Stressor\nThree forced_failure tasks were used to elicit distress_ The first was a facial identification task with false feedback indicating that the participant performed poorly_ This 10_minute task was adapted from Tran_ Siemer_ and Joormann _2011__ Participants were asked to identify the emotional expression _happy_ sad_ angry_ depicted in subliminally presented facial expressions_ Participants repeatedly received feedback that they were performing poorly relative to others who had already completed the task_ and the experimenter urged participants to try harder_ The second task was an anagram task_ in which approximately 30_ of the anagrams were unsolvable_ Participants were given 5 minutes to solve as many anagrams as possible but allowed only 30 seconds to solve each anagram_ In the third task_ participants were given 5 minutes to count backward aloud from 2_083 to zero in 13_step sequences _Kirschbaum et al__ 1993__\n\nRumination and Distraction Induction\nParticipants were randomly assigned to either a rumination or cognitive distraction condition_ which was adapted from the standard rumination and distraction _R_D_ task created by Nolen_Hoeksema and Morrow _1993__ Regardless of the condition_ participants viewed seven prompts one_at_a_time on the computer screen_ and they were asked to think and write about each prompt for two minutes_ Rumination prompts focused participants_ attention on thoughts that were emotion or self_focused _e_g__ _why your performance on the tests earlier today made you feel the way it did_ or _what people would think of you if they had observed you complete the tests earlier today___ In contrast_ cognitive distraction prompts focused participants_ attention on thoughts unrelated to the self _e_g__ _how to make a peanut_butter_and_jelly sandwich_ Describe it in detail_ with as many steps as possible__ or _the layout of your local mall_ Walk the entire length in your mind and describe the stores_ things_ or people you would see___ Participants_ written statements were later coded based on Hilt and Pollak _2013_ by two independent raters who were blind to group and condition_ Rumination score ratings were made on a 5_point Likert scale ranging from 1 _Not at all ruminating_ to 5 _Completely ruminating__ ICC _ _84_\n\nMeasures\nSadness ratings We examined sadness ratings assessed at 4 points_ at the end of the baseline period_ in the middle of the forced_failure induction_ immediately before the R_D induction_ and immediately after the R_D induction_ Participants rated their sadness on an 11_point Likert_scale ranging from 0 _not at all_ to 10 _very much__ We focused on sadness as opposed to other metrics of affect _e_g__ general negative affect_ given that sadness is central to MDD_ a common response to forced_failure stressors _Hammen_ 2005__ and the affective dimension most directly targeted by our rumination induction _Nolen_Hoeksema _ Morrow_ 1993__\nRespiratory sinus arrhythmia _RSA_ Electrocardiograph _ECG_ and respiration frequency were recorded with a computer_based data acquisition system _MP150_ Biopac Systems__ Three standard electrodes were attached bilaterally to participants_ left and right upper rib cage and right collarbone_ To measure respiration frequency_ a strain_gauge transducer belt was attached around the chest above the ribcage and below the bust_ Data was collected using BIOPAC bioamplifiers_ The ECG and respiration frequency signals were sampled at a rate of 1_000 Hz_ digitized with a 16_bit analog_to_digital converter_ and processed using AcqKnowledge and MindWare software_ Following recommendations of the Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology _1996__ we used a frequency domain measure of heart rate variability_ namely RSA_ Thus_ vagal activation was indexed by measuring heart rate variability in the frequency band between _14 and _4 Hz _high frequency_ heart rate variability__ R_wave markers in the ECG signal were evaluated for artifacts by visual inspection and the MAD_MED artifact detection algorithm implemented in MindWare software _Mindware Heart Rate Variability Application_ version 2_51_ Mindware Technologies Ltd___ Identified artifacts were then manually corrected_ Beat_to_beat interval series were obtained from the ECG and converted into time series of instantaneous beat_to_beat intervals with a resolution of 4 Hz_ Spectral analysis using the Welch method determined the power spectral density in the frequency band between _14 and _4 Hz_ This value is then automatically log_transformed to correct for the non_normal distribution_ and minute_by_minute estimates of RSA were determined_ This approach accords with best_practice guidelines for frequency domain methods to calculate RSA _Berntson et al__ 1993_ Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology_ 1996__ Data were then analyzed in 5_minute increments_ or as close to this interval as tasks would allow_ Specifically_ RSA was measured during the following four periods_ 1_ During the 5_minute nature video _baseline__ which occurred immediately before the forced_failure stressor_ 2_ During the first 5 minutes of the forced_failure stressor_ 3_ During the 5 minutes immediately before the R_D induction_ when participants were completing the forced_failure stressor _approximately 15_20 minutes after the forced_failure onset__ and 4_ During the first 6 minutes of the R_D induction _i_e__ during the first three R_D prompts__\nQuestionnaires Participants completed the Beck Depression Inventory_II _BDI_ Beck_ Steer_ _ Brown_ 1996__ a 21_item measure assessing depressive symptom severity __ _ _97__ Additionally_ participants completed the Ruminative Responses Scale of the Response Style Questionnaire _RRS_ Nolen_Hoeksema _ Morrow_ 1991__ a 22_item self_report questionnaire assessing individual differences in the tendency to ruminate when sad __ _ _99__\nProcedure\nAfter participants provided informed consent_ approximately 5 minutes were taken to attach psychophysiological equipment and ensure the accurate collection of RSA data_ Participants then watched a 5_minute nature video followed by the forced_failure stressor_ Next_ participants were randomly assigned to the rumination or cognitive distraction condition of the R_D induction_ Before leaving the laboratory_ participants watched a calming nature video in order to provide ample time for mood to return to baseline_ Participants completed demographic and clinical questionnaires at the end of the experiment_\n\nData Analysis\nAnalyses were conducted with SPSS version 20_0_ Baseline and demographic data were analyzed via one_way analysis of variance _ANOVA_ and chi square tests_ To examine the effect of the forced_failure stressor and R_D induction on self_reported sadness and RSA_ we examined the changes in sadness and RSA as a result of the forced_failure stressor and R_D induction_ For example_ sadness reactivity to the forced_failure stressor was calculated as sadness rated during the forced_failure induction minus sadness at baseline_ Sadness reactivity to the R_D induction was calculated as sadness rated after the R_D induction minus sadness immediately before the R_D induction_ Positive scores indicate increases in sadness_ negative scores indicate decreases in sadness_ Similarly_ RSA reactivity during the forced_failure stressor was calculated as RSA measured during the first five minutes of the forced_failure stressor minus RSA measured during the five minutes immediately before the forced_failure stressor_ RSA reactivity during the R_D induction was calculated as RSA measured during the first six minutes of the R_D induction minus RSA measured during the five minutes immediately before the R_D induction_ Positive scores indicate RSA activation_ negative scores indicate RSA withdrawal_ Univariate ANOVAs were used to examine reactivity and recovery scores by group _MDD_ CTL_ and condition _rumination_ cognitive distraction__\n\nGo to_\nResults\nParticipant

to rumination and distraction in MDD_ little is known about the consequences of using these emotion regulation strategies on RSA_ To the best of our knowledge_ the current study is the first to examine whether clinically depressed and healthy control participants display different affective and parasympathetic responses to a rumination and cognitive distraction induction_ As expected_ rumination increased sadness and triggered RSA withdrawal for both MDDs and CTLs_ Interestingly_ although cognitive distraction reduced sadness_ it also triggered RSA withdrawal_ Moreover_ cognitive distraction was associated with greater RSA withdrawal for MDDs than CTLs_ For MDDs_ RSA withdrawal was also greater during cognitive distraction than rumination_\n\nRSA withdrawal during rumination is in line with numerous studies reporting that both anger and depressive rumination is associated with less parasympathetic activation in analogue samples _e_g__ Gerin et al__ 2006_ Key et al__ 2008_ Ottaviani et al__ 2009__ It also parallels the broader literature_ which finds cardiovascular activation during perseverative thinking _ including worry_ rumination_ or trauma recall _ in analogue samples _Brosschot et al__ 2006_ Verkuil et al__ 2009__ Our data extend this literature by comparing clinically depressed and healthy control participants_ Results demonstrate that the effect of rumination on RSA withdrawal did not significantly differ between MDDs and CTLs_ This finding is relevant to models of cardiovascular disease that include rumination as a mechanism through which MDD heightens risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality _Brosschot et al__ 2006_ Rozanski_ Blumenthal_ _ Kaplan_ 1999_ Rugulies_ 2002__ More specifically_ results from our study suggest that depressed individuals may be at heightened risk for cardiovascular disease not because rumination has a greater effect on RSA in MDDs than in CTLs_ but because MDDs spend more time using an emotion regulation strategy that is associated with parasympathetic withdrawal_ Given that rumination produced similar RSA withdrawal in the MDD and CTL groups_ models of cardiovascular risk might include not only the cardiovascular effects of rumination but also the frequency with which individuals ruminate in everyday life_\n\nIn addition_ the current study examined the effects of cognitive distraction on RSA and found RSA withdrawal instead of RSA activation_ Our results stand in contrast to observations of cardiovascular recovery during passive distraction _e_g__ Gerin et al__ 2006_ Ottaviani et al__ 2008_ Ottaviani et al__ 2009__ For example_ cardiovascular recovery from stress _ indexed via increased parasympathetic activity or decreased sympathetic activity _ has been observed when passively viewing neutral pictures and posters _Gerin et al__ 2006_ or when distracted by overhearing a fabricated phone conversation _Ottaviani et al__ 2008_ 2009_ 2011__ An important difference between our distraction task and passive distraction tasks is that our task required participants to engage in effortful control over their thoughts_ In fact_ it is this effort that has been posited to drive parasympathetic withdrawal during cognitive tasks _Luft et al__ 2009_ Reynard et al__ 2011__ Interestingly_ greater effort has long been associated with parasympathetic withdrawal _Lundberg _ Frankenhaeuser_ 1980__ Moreover_ evidence from other experimental paradigms shows that tasks requiring cognitive effort lead to parasympathetic withdrawal _Duschek_ Muckenthaler_ Werner_ _ Reys del Paso_ 2009_ Luft_ Takase_ _ Darby_ 2009_ Reynard_ Gevirtz_ Berlow_ Brown_ _ Boutelle_ 2011_ Verkuil_ Brosschot_ Borkovec_ _ Thayer_ 2009_ although see also Butler_ Wilhelm_ _ Gross_ 2006_ and Segerstrom _ Solberg Nes_ 2007_ for evidence of parasympathetic activation__ For example_ studies report less parasympathetic activity when participants control the content of thoughts by thinking and writing about an assigned topic compared to baseline parasympathetic activity _Reynard et al__ 2011_ or when participants think about moral questions __Is it appropriate for your friend to misrepresent his curriculum vitae in order to get a job___ Verkuil et al__ 2009__ Luft et al_ _2009_ also reported lower parasympathetic activity during tasks requiring high versus low cognitive effort_ More specifically_ greater parasympathetic withdrawal was observed during a one_back working memory task compared to a simple reaction time task_\n\nWe also observed greater RSA withdrawal during cognitive distraction in the MDD versus CTL group_ Given evidence connecting effort and parasympathetic withdrawal _Lundberg _ Frankenhaeuser_ 1980__ greater RSA withdrawal in the MDD group could reflect greater effort required for depressed individuals to engage in cognitive distraction following sadness_inducing failure_ This interpretation is in line with behavioral data showing that depressed participants are slower to disengage from negative material _see reviews by Gotlib _ Joormann_ 2010_ Joormann_ 2010_ Koster_ De Lissnyder_ Derakshan_ _ De Raedt_ 2011__ It is further supported by evidence that depressed individuals show greater activation in brain regions subserving cognitive control _dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and the insula_ when removing negative material from working memory _Foland_Ross_ Hamilton_ Joormann_ Berman_ Jonidees_ _ Gotlib_ 2013__ Furthermore_ during cognitive distraction_ individuals with remitted depression exhibited increased neural activity compared to healthy controls in the regulating control_network_ including the anterior cingulate _Kanske_ Heissler_ Sch_nfelder_ _ Wessa_ 2012__ The idea of cognitive effort leading to parasympathetic withdrawal is also in line with research showing lower parasympathetic activity in other clinical groups when using adaptive_ yet effortful_ emotion regulation strategies _Aldao _ Mennin_ 2012__ Specifically_ Aldao and Mennin found that individuals with generalized anxiety disorder exhibited lower parasympathetic activity when using acceptance or reappraisal to regulate their emotions compared to when passively viewing a film_ Importantly_ in the current study_ despite group differences in parasympathetic withdrawal during cognitive distraction_ both healthy controls and clinically depressed participants were able to use distraction to repair the sad mood that was induced during the forced_failure period_ Thus_ although cognitive distraction appears to facilitate emotional recovery from stress_ it may be associated with greater cognitive effort for individuals with MDD_ In fact_ for individuals with MDD_ RSA withdrawal was even greater during cognitive distraction than rumination_ further emphasizing the effort required for this population to engage in cognitive distraction_ The fact that we observed a different pattern of findings for RSA and self_reported affect in the MDD versus CTL group underscores the importance of adding physiological measures to clinical assessments_\n\nIt is also noteworthy that_ in this study_ baseline RSA did not differ between MDD and CTL participants_ Interestingly_ the literature on baseline RSA in depression is mixed_ Whereas some studies report lower RSA levels in depressed compared to control participants _Dalack _ Roose_ 1990_ Lehofer et al__ 1999_ Rottenberg_ Clift_ Bolden_ _ Salomon_ 2007__ others report no differences in RSA levels _e_g__ Lehofer et al__ 1997_ Moser et al__ 1998__ Although a meta_analysis conducted by Rottenberg _2007_ found that depression was associated with lower levels of resting RSA _d _ _33__ only 6 of the 39 comparisons indicated a significant difference between depressed and control participants_ and depression accounted for only about 2_ of the variance in RSA_ Moreover_ Rottenberg _2007_ concludes that the overall effect of depression on RSA likely reflects an upper_bound estimate that may be very modest after accounting for confounds and unpublished studies_ thereby casting doubt on the effects of depression on baseline RSA_ When incorporating our findings on baseline RSA into the broader literature_ it is important to consider the fact that we measured baseline RSA while participants were watching a calming nature video_ which may have served as a passive distraction task_ which has been shown to increase parasympathetic activity _Gerin et al__ 2006_ Ottaviani et al__ 2009_ 2011__ We_ therefore_ caution against direct comparison between baseline RSA measured in the current study with that measured in studies where participants are not engaging in any activity_\n\nThe current study has several limitations_ For one_ comorbid health conditions were determined based on participants_ self report_ and it is possible that participants may have been unaware of prior cardiovascular conditions that would have affected RSA_ However_ using reactivity and recovery_ as opposed to raw scores_ minimized external sources of variability_ Nonetheless_ future work might consider including a physical checkup_ Future studies might also include additional measures of cardiovascular health_ including blood pressure or pre_ejection period _PEP__ A second limitation is that the current study did not directly assess self_reported effort_ which prevents us from drawing a direct connection between effort and parasympathetic withdrawal during the cognitive distraction induction_ Lastly_ despite random assignment to the cognitive distraction and rumination conditions_ there was an unequal proportion of female participants across cells_ Importantly_ however_ the group by condition interaction on RSA recovery remained significant when sex was included in the model_\n\nDespite these limitations_ the current study offers a unique examination of parasympathetic activity during a rumination and cognitive distraction induction in clinically depressed versus healthy control participants_ Findings demonstrate that the effect of rumination on RSA did not significantly differ between the MDD and CTL groups_ In addition_ the current study provides the first evidence of the effects of cognitive distraction on RSA in MDD_ Our results demonstrate that distraction leads to greater parasympathetic withdrawal_ indexed via RSA withdrawal_ for MDDs than CTLs_ which may reflect that depressed individuals require additional effort to disengage from negative material_ We hope that this study also demonstrates the importance and feasibility of incorporating physiological measures into assessments of emotion regulation_ Assessing RSA activity can provide information about parasympathetic activation that cannot be obtained from self_report measures_ Thus_ information on RSA could help understand the effects of different emotion regulation strategies on patients_ physical health_ which is especially relevant for patients with comorbid health conditions_ In addition_ to the extent that RSA withdrawal indexes cognitive effort_ examining changes in RSA during cognitive distraction may prove a useful tool to assess skill integration as treatment progresses_ With practice_ cognitive distraction should become less effortful for depressed individuals_ leading to less RSA withdrawal_ These assessment options are possible given that RSA provides a low_cost physiological measure that can be assessed with minimal disruption in applied research and clinical settings_ With the development of devices to collect ambulatory RSA_ barriers to data collection have decreased even further_ Future work might examine parasympathetic activation during other emotion regulation strategies_ including the use of emotion regulation strategies in naturalistic settings_ Additionally_ investigators conducting research in applied or clinical settings might test whether parasympathetic withdrawal during cognitive distraction decreases with treatment or practice_\n\nGo to_\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported by grant F31_MH086246_\n\nGo to_\nFootnotes\n1Including sex as a covariate did not affect the
