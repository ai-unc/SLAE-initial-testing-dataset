IPV strongly associates with AEP (Anderson et al., 2014; Kitsantas et al., 2015; Li et al., 2012; Skagerstrom et al., 2011). For every additional physical IPV indicator experienced within the five-year span (averaged over all relationships), compared to other individuals, increased the overall odds of AEP compared to non-pregnancy by 200%, and increased the overall odds of AEP compared to nAEP by 154%. Therefore, not only did IPV have within-relationship influence, but also distinguished AEP outcomes between individuals."

Individuals who reported past-year infrequent drinking in adolescence, compared to those who reported abstention or no past year drinking, increased odds of overall AEP compared to nAEP in adulthood by 175%. Those who reported heavy or moderate past-year drinking in adolescence, compared to those who reported abstention or no past year drinking, increased odds of AEP in adulthood by 176% (compared to no-pregnancy) or 195% (compared to nAEP). Therefore, adolescent drinking overall increased higher odds of AEP compared to either non-pregnancy or nAEP outcomes in adulthood."
