The review establishes several correlational relationships in the context of substance use and disorder among American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations in the United States. Notably, AI/AN status correlates with elevated rates of substance-related mortality, with alcohol-related deaths, chronic liver disease, and drug-related issues being notably higher. Additionally, AI/AN adolescents exhibit earlier initiation and higher rates of substance use, particularly among those living on reservations or who have dropped out of school, while AI/AN adults who drink tend to engage in heavy, episodic drinking patterns. Correlations are also observed between AI/AN communities and substance availability, trauma exposure, family and peer networks, and historical trauma, all of which impact substance use patterns and disparities within these communities. These correlational findings emphasize the multifaceted nature of substance use issues in AI/AN populations and highlight potential areas for targeted intervention and prevention efforts.

Given the text validate a series of relationships between variables that will be included in a json format below.
For example, if the json includes a relation like "Country's per capita income -> Country's literacy rate", and the text includes "We find a strong correlation p < .0001 between a country's per capita income and it's literacy rate" then the RelationshipClassification would be direct.
If instead the text includes ""We find a strong inverse correlation p < .0001 between a country's per capita income and it's literacy rate" then the RelationshipClassification would be inverse.
The SupportText field of your output should include verbaitum text related to the relation between the two variables without paraphrasing.
The Reasoning field should be used to step by step reason from the text of the paper to try to come up with a good relationship classification and should focus on plainly stated results over implications.
The RelationshipClassification field can only be 'direct', 'inverse', 'not applicable', or 'uncorrelated'.
Direct means that an increase in one would cause a decrease in another, and inverse means that an increase in one would cause a decrease in another.
Uncorrelated means there is no clear relationship between the two variables. Not applicable means the text does not suggest anything about the relationship between the two variables. 
Use exactly wording of outputs choices and input variable names, including capitalization choices. 

OUTPUT FORMATTING INSTRUCTIONS START
