functioning and working memory associated with frontal lobe dysfunction are prominent in depression\nand work_related long_term sick leave _LTSL__ This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging _fMRI_ to investigate\npotential differences in brain activation patterns in these conditions_ In addition_ the function of the hypothalamic_pituitary_adrenal _HPA_ axis was examined and compared between groups_ Since there is a clear overrepresentation of women in thesediagnostic groups_ and to ensure a more homogenous sample population_ only women were included_ To examine the

Mental Disorders_ Fourth Edition _DSM_IV criteria_untreated__ and healthy controls _ n_10_ each group__ a 2_back working memory task and a visual long_term memory task\nwere administered during fMRI scanning_ HPA axis functioning was investigated using a diurnal curve of saliva cortisol and a\ndexamethasone suppression test_ Task performance was comparable among the three groups_ Multivariate image analysisrevealed that both memory tasks engaged a similar brain network in all three groups_ including the prefrontal and parietalcortex_ During the 2_back task_ LTSL patients had signi_cant frontal hypoactivation compared to controls and patients with\ndepression_ Saliva cortisol measurements showed a _attening of the diurnal rythmicity in LTSL patients compared to patients\nwith depression and healthy contols_ Taken together_ these _ndings indicate that work stress_related LTSL and majordepression are dissociable in terms of frontal activation and diurnal cortisol

stress as the main causeof disease _The Swedish National Social InsuranceBoard 2003__\nResearch efforts in the _eld of work_related stress are\ncomplicated by the lack of consensus about diagnostic\ncriteria_ Depression is the category of use in the _eld ofstress_related disorders_ despite the fact that severalscienti_c papers indicate that depression and work_related stress do not share patterns of physiological andpsychological changes _Rydmark et al_ 2006_ Wahlberget al_ 2009__ The concept of burnout is initially adescription of the frustration and emotional detach_ment seen in social and health workers _Mason 1975_Maslach et al_ 2001__ Originally_ the term was not\nmeant as a classi_cation of disease_ but rather a\ndescription of the process of exhaustion or adaptationto

code _i_e_ exhaustion syndrome F43_8_ toclassify the closely related terms_ clinical burnout_ vitalexhaustion_ and mental fatigue_ As proposed byA _sberg\nand co_workers_ burnout should not be considered a\nnecessary or suf_cient condition for developing stress_\nrelated disease_ Rather_ it is a process or coping strategyto endure challenging situations at work that may leadto disease or exhaustion syndrome _Asberg et al_ 2010__Since there is no international consensus on this issue_we have used the term work_related LTSL in this study_\nThe symptoms of individuals on work_related LTSL\noverlap with core symptoms of major depression_Wahlberg et al_ 2009__ which has prompted examin_ations of whether individuals on LTSL due to work\nstress and patients with major depression share HPA\naxis pathophysiology _Rydmark et al_ 2006__ Thoughmajor depression has been associated with up_regulated reactivity of the HPA axis_ patients withstress were found to exhibit a marked decrease in thereactivity of the HPA axis _Wahlberg et al_ 2009__ In thesame study_ no support was obtained for a reduction inhippocampal volume_ and cognitive impairment wasmore indicative of a disruption of the frontocorticalsystem rather than hippocampus dysfunction_ We and\nothers have reported a similar pattern of neurocogni_\ntive alterations in stressed patients_ with evidence offrontal cognitive de_cits _Sandstrom et al_ 2005_ andintact hippocampal volume _Sandstrom et al_ 2011__In contrast_ major depression has repeatedly been\nassociated with lowered performance on hippocampal_dependent explicit_episodic memory tasks _Airaksinenet al_ 2004_ and reduced hippocampal volume_Videbech and Ravnkilde 2004__\nCollectively_ these _ndings suggest differences\nbetween major depression and chronic stress_ Inparticular_ individuals on LTSL due to work stresstend to exhibit frontal_ rather than hippocampal_dysfunction_ This view is in line with a notion of thestress_brain link that implicates many cortical andsubcortical regions other than the hippocampus_including the frontal cortex _Lupien and Lepage2001__ Converging evidence indicates that not only\naffective but also cognitive regions in the frontal lobes\nare dysfunctional in major depression _Steele et al_2007__ and patients suffering from major depressionexhibit a pattern of cognitive dysfunction that extendsbeyond the domain of explicit_episodic memory toexecutive_ frontal lobe_sensitive tasks _Stordal et al_2004_ Dahlin et al_ 2008__ Furthermore_ imagingstudies have suggested an increased activity in thesubgenual anterior cingulate cortex _sACC_ inpatients with depression_ which is decreased by\nsuccessful treatment _Mayberg et al_ 2003_ 2005__\nDirect_ within_study_ comparisons of patients on\nLTSL due to work stress and patients with majordepression are critical for addressing the questions ofwhether these two categories re_ect a shared or distinctpathophysiology_ To date_ such studies are rare and_ tothe best of our knowledge_ no prior study hascompared the functional brain responses of patientsfrom each category while engaged in memory tasks_\nThe main objective of this study was to compare\nfunctional magnetic resonance imaging _fMRI_\npatterns and diurnal cortisol across three groups__i_ controls_ _ii_ acute unmedicated patients withunipolar major depression_

_McIntosh and Lobaugh 2004__\nUsing PLS_ it is feasible to extract the commonality aswell as the differences of brain activations acrossdifferent groups_ Here_ the critical interest was toinvestigate whether there were any group differencesin brain activity in relation to the three tasks_\nBehavioral PLS analyzes the relationship between\nthe behavioral measures _e_g_ reaction times_ and the\nfunctional brain activity of groups_ The procedure is\nroughly the same as the one described above for taskPLS_ but instead of mean centering_ a correlation\nanalysis is conducted between the data and behavioralmeasures_ As such behavioral saliencies were obtainedfrom SVD indicating task_dependent differences in\nthe brain_behavior correlation_ A similar pattern of\nscores depicting

patterns and diurnalcortisol between acute unmedicated patients withunipolar major depression and patients on LTSL dueto work stress_ Of main interest was to examinewhether LTSL patients under_recruited parts offrontal cortex during cognitive processing_\nThe fMRI results showed pronounced similarities in\nactivation patterns across the groups_ suggestinglargely intact functional networks_ This was furthersubstantiated by intact cognitive performance_However_ during the more demanding cognitive task_n_back__ the LTSL subjects showed a reduction\nin prefrontal cortex activation_ Speci_cally_ a groupdifference was observed in the right dorsolateraland left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex_ In addition_response times during n_back correlated with brain\nactivity for controls and depressed patients but not forthe LTSL subjects_ who tended to have a slowerresponse_ This pattern of slowed response andreduced frontal activity in patients with stress disorderis consistent with previous _ndings that patients withstress exhibit reduced performance on cognitivelydemanding tasks that are assumed to re_ect theintegrity of frontal lobe functioning _Rydmark et al_\n2006_ Ohman et al_ 2007_ Sandstrom et al_ 2011__\nIn particular_ the _ndings from the brain_cognitioncorrelation analysis are indicative of alterations offunctional working memory networks in LTSLpatients_ Still_ as this observation was found in amore exploratory analysis and was based on arelatively small group of patients_ further generali_zations must await future replication_\nMore generally_ the present _ndings are in line with\nthe view that the frontal cortex may be as critical as thehippocampus when it comes to the regulation ofstress _Lupien et al_ 2009__ Notably_ this is a dualrelationship_ as the medial prefrontal cortex as well asthe hippocampus may be an important target forglucocorticoid actions _Herman et al_ 2005__ Indeed_a recent study has shown that chronic stress or chronicadministration of glucocorticoids produces dendriticremodeling in prefrontal pyramidal neurons _Martin\nand Wellman 2011__\nThe diurnal saliva cortisol curve for the LTSL\npatients showed a trend toward _attening with highercortisol levels at 11_00 h_ whereas controls anddepressed patients had similar diurnal patterns_ Itremains to be determined if a blunted diurnal

days_\nincluding different weekdays_ might provide\nadditional insight_ Also_ estimation of the cortisolawakening response be of interest_ since severalstudies have suggested an altered awakening responsein different neuropsychiatric conditions _Kudielka andWust 2010__ We did not _nd any difference in DEXsuppression between depressed subjects and controls_This is of interest and suggests that

dysfunction_volume whichmay relate to dysfunctional feedback function in theHPA axis_ The number of participants in this studywas also insuf_cient to reveal subgroups of depressedpatients with different HPA axis activity_ It has alsobeen suggested that age of onset for depression mayin_uence hippocampal function_volume_ but this is amatter of controversy _MacQueen and Frodl 2011__\nThe healthy subjects and depressed patients showed\nmarked similarities in brain activation patterns_despite the fact that depressed subjects indicatedpoorer health in all measures of subjective well_being_Notably_ the depressed group did not show theincreased sACC activity that has been reported earlierby Mayberg et al_ _1999_ and Mayberg _2003__ Thesediscrepancies may be related to the fact that thedepressed patients in this study were recentlydiagnosed_ Repeated episodes of major depression_\nas well as the severity of episodes_ are known to\ncorrelate with structural and functional changes in thebrain_ possibly re_ecting hypersecretion of glucocor_ticoids _Sapolsky 2000__ Taken together_ the amountof time a person is sick might be a crucial factor fordeveloping changes in frontal lobe functioning_Importantly_ we wanted to avoid treatment withanxiolytics and other substances known to in_uencecognitive function_ thereby creating another possibleconfounder_ An additional possible confounder is the\nyounger age of the depressed group vs_ the LTSL\ngroup in our study_ Finally_ it is possible that the highscores in experienced stress and burnout in ourdepressed group raise the possibility that some of themare suffering from work_related stress_\nIn summary_ the present _ndings suggest a\ndifference between patient categories_ such thatlong_term stress relative to acute depression induceschanges in functional brain activity_ notably in areaswithin the frontal cortex_ as well as a _attening of the\ndiurnal cortisol curve_ These _ndings need to be\nvalidated in
