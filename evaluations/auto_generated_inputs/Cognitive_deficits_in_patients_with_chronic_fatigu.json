Introduction\nChronic fatigue syndrome _CFS_ is a debilitating condition that is\ncharacterized by chronic fatigue_ impairment of short_term mem_ory and musculoskeletal pain _1__ CFS is marked by persistent or\nrelapsing debilitating fatigue that_ _1_ does not resolve with bedrest_ _2_ is severe enough to reduce daily activity_ and _3_ has nosomatic explanation _2__ A number of symptoms may be present_\nincluding myalgia_ headache_ sore throat_ and pains in the joints_Cognitive complaints are also frequently reported_ particularly inrelation to memory and concentration _3_7_ _ However_ although\npatients with CFS often complain of cognitive dif_culties_ neu_ropsychological studies that have attempted to objectively measurecognitive de_cits in such patients have yielded con_icting results_\n_H22845Data presented at the APA meeting in Washington_ May 6_ 2008_ poster NR5_047_\n_Corresponding author at_ Service de psychiatrie_ Cliniques Universitaires Saint_\nLuc_ Avenue

healthy controls_\nMoreover_ because cognitive de_cits are core symptoms of MDD\n_18_19_ and because CFS patients have high rates of major current\nand lifetime depressive episodes _20_ _ depression must be consid_\nered a possible explanation for the cognitive dysfunction in CFS_Indeed_ it has been suggested that cognitive complaints in CFS maybe attributable to a depressive process in somatically focused indi_viduals _17_ _ Such an explanation would suf_ce if a correlation\nbetween symptoms of depression and anxiety and certain neu_ropsychological measures had been observed _as for example instudies _6_7_11_17_21_ __ However_ this is not the case in all studies\n_3_5_13_15_22_25_ _ In addition_ the possible direct effect of fatigue\non cognitive performance in CFS has also been examined_ Althoughmost authors _5_6_25_27_ found no relationship between the level\nof fatigue and performance on memory and attention tests_ one wasnoted by Joyce et al_ _13_ _ Thus_ the direct effect of fatigue on cogni_\ntive performance in CFS remains unclear_ In another condition_ thepost_polio syndrome_ Ostlund et al_ _28_ also did not _nd a relation_\nship between general fatigue and cognitive de_cits_ Finally_ thereare multiple methodological dif_culties in the neuropsychologicalliterature on CFS_ for example_ heterogeneity in the diagnosis of CFSacross studies_ presence of comorbid depression_ and lack of controlgroups_\nIt is_ therefore_ dif_cult to clarify whether there are objective\ncognitive de_cits in patients with CFS_ particularly in terms of mem_ory and executive functions_ or whether the cognitive impairmentsare directly associated with the depressive symptoms in this con_dition_ Hence_ we evaluated as a primary objective_ the cognitiveperformance of patients with CFS using standardized verbal andvisual memory tests_ as well as sustained attention_ phasic alert_ness_ and the fatigue effect_ compared with a control group ofhealthy volunteers_ We investigated the same variables in a groupof patients with MDD_ Particular attention was paid to the evalua_tion of the quantitative dimension of depressive symptoms in thepatients with CFS_ Investigation of attention and memory functionswas chosen because these are the functions most often reportedas impaired in CFS but also in MDD_ Our primary hypothesis wasthat patients with CFS would have cognitive impairments that wereonly partially correlated with the depressive dimension of the con_dition_ suggesting that some cognitive impairments may be presentindependent of the depressive dimension_ The partial relationshipbetween cognitive and depressive symptomatology could be con__rmed by direct comparison with the MDD group_\nIn addition to these primary objectives_ we wanted to inves_\ntigate the possible gap between the subjective and objectivedimensions of cognition_ as some studies have reported moresubjective complaints than objective impairments_ Our secondaryobjectives were_ therefore_ to examine the subjects_ reactions tosuggestibility_ Some authors _29_ have argued that subjects with\nCFS are more suggestible than healthy persons using a measure ofgeneral suggestibility and the hypnotic induction pro_le _HIP_ _30_ _\nAnother way to approach this question would be to investigate taskinvolvement in order to exclude de_cit feigning and the attributionof cognitive de_cits to the possibility that CFS patients may be lessthan optimally motivated in the tasks _thus expending less effortbecause of a metacognitive belief of cognitive impairment__2_ Materials and methods\n2_1_ Subjects\nWe studied 25 patients with CFS_ 25 patients with MDD_\nand 25 healthy control subjects _see Table 1 for demographic\nparameters of these three groups__ All of

MDD patientsfrom the outpatient psychiatric unit of the Cliniques UniversitairesSaint_Luc_ Brussels_ The healthy controls were recruited from thecare staff and volunteers of the Cliniques Universitaires Saint_Lucand from volunteer associations_ Before entering the study_ patientsand controls gave their informed consent to a protocol approved bythe Medical Ethics Committee of the School of Medicine of the Uni_versit_ catholique de Louvain_ The patients and the control subjectsunderwent a psychiatric interview supplemented by the StructuralClinical Interview for DSM_IV Axis I Disorders _SCID_ _31_ to con_rm\nthe diagnosis of unipolar major depressive episodes in the patientswith MDD and the absence of any Axis I psychiatric disorder inthe controls and the patients with CFS _in particular the absence ofMDD__ Exclusion criteria for the control subjects were unexplainedfatigue_ an organic condition that causes fatigue_ an unstable med_ical condition_ an organic brain disorder_ the use of psychotropicdrugs_ and a current or past mental disorder on the basis of theSCID I interview_\n2_2_ Procedure\n2_2_1_ Self_questionnaires\nSeveral scales were used to assess anxiety_ depression_ and\nfatigue_ The 40_item State Trait Anxiety Inventory Scale _STAI A_B _ _32_ assesses anxiety symptoms_ The _rst sub_scale indicates\nthe state of anxiety at the moment of the session _STAI_A__ thesecond sub_scale indicates the subject_s anxiety traits _STAI_B__The results are converted into T_scores_ A French version of the21_item Beck Depression Inventory _BDI_ _33_ assesses depression\nin adults _34_ _ The scores range from 0 to 63_ A score of 13 or\nless indicates a non_depressed state_ a score from 14 to 19 corre_sponds to _mildly depressed__ and a score over 20 indicates clinicaldepression_ The geriatric depression scale _GDS_ _35_ is a 30_item\ninstrument for assessing depression_ The value of this questionnaireis that physical symptoms are excluded_ whereas other instrumentsof depression assessment are too rich in somatic symptoms andtoo poor in cognitive symptoms_ Scores range from 0 to 30_ A scoreof 10 or less is considered to indicate the absence of depressivesymptoms_ and a score over 11 re_ects the presence of depressivesymptoms_ The fatigue severity scale _FSS_ _36_ is a 9_item scale\nassessing _disabling fatigue__ Total scores range from 9 to 63_ Thehigher the score_ the more the fatigue is disabling_E_L_ Constant et al_ _ Clinical Neurology and Neurosurgery 113 _2011_ 295_302 297\n2_2_2_ Cognitive tasks\nAttention was assessed with one computerized reaction time\ntest_ the Phasic Alertness Task of the TEA1_5 battery _37_ _ In this\ntask_ the subject is instructed to press a button as quickly as possibleas soon as a cross appears in the centre of the screen_ In one con_dition_ the cross is preceded by a warning signal _i_e__ a beep_ whilein the other condition there is no warning signal_ The median reac_tion time for correctly detected crosses is calculated for each of thetwo conditions _i_e__ with and without an audible warning signal__Phasic alertness re_ects optimization of the state of preparation orreactivity of a subject when the information he_she has to deal withis preceded by a signal warning of its imminent appearance_\nIn addition to this reaction time task_ two working memory tasks\nwere administered_ The _rst was the computerized working mem_ory task of the TEA1_5 battery _37_ where the subject has to press\non a button when a given stimulus _a digit which appears in thecentre of the screen_ is identical to a stimulus shown previously_the next to last digit shown on the screen__ A hundred digits from1 to 9 were presented in succession at 3_s inter_stimulus intervals_The median reaction time for correct responses and the numbersof correct responses and errors are recorded_ The second workingmemory task was the computerized paced auditory serial attentiontest _PASAT_ _38_ where single digits are presented auditorily_ Sub_\njects were instructed to add each new digit to the one immediatelyprior to it_ The test score is the total number of correct sums givenin each trial_\nFinally_ two episodic memory tasks _one verbal and the other\nvisual_ were also administered_ The verbal task was the word mem_ory test _WMT_ _39_ _ This computerized memory test measures the\nability to learn a list of 20 pairs of words displayed on the screen_e_g__ pig_bacon_ There are then six sub_tests_ immediate recogni_tion _IR__ delayed recognition _DR__ multiple choice _MC__ pairedassociates _PA__ free recall _FR__ and long delayed free recall _LDFR__Visual episodic memory was assessed using the _Doors test_ _40_ in\nwhich subjects are instructed to memorize two series of 12 picturesof doors _garage doors_ front doors_ etc___ Each door is shown for 3 sand then the subject is asked to recognize the door _target items_from a choice of four pictures of doors _score ranging between 0and 24__\n2_2_3_ Cognitive fatigue assessment\nIn addition to the subjective assessment of fatigue using the\nfatigue severity scale_ we assessed fatigue more objectively byadministering the phasic alertness part of the TEA again at theend of the testing session _which took approximately an hour anda half__ A fatigue index _total reaction times of Alertness test 2minus total reaction times of Alertness test 1_ was calculated andcompared among groups using an ANOVA_ A higher fatigue indexindicated a stronger effect of fatigue on phasic alertness_\n2_2_4_ Suggestibility and lack of effort _simulation_\nWe also added some tasks and_or indexes assessing suggestibil_\nity and lack of effort_ Suggestibility is de_ned as the tendency torespond to suggestions_ The effect of suggestibility was assessed bydividing the PASAT into two equal parts_ Half_way through the testthere was a pause_ and the investigator said_ _Now_ after this _rstpart of the test_ you probably feel a certain degree of fatigue_ whichwe will investigate before going on with the task__ The subject hadto assess his_her subjective fatigue on a 7_point Likert scale _fatigueseverity scale_ FSS_ ranging from _no fatigue_ to _extreme fatigue___A suggestibility index _total score of PASAT 2 minus total score ofPASAT 1_ was calculated and compared among the groups using anANOVA_ A higher negative index indicated a greater deteriorationof scores on PASAT 2 and thus a greater response to suggestibility_\nFor the assessment of simulation _or lack of effort__ we used\na speci_c task_ the Amsterdam Short Memory Test _short version__41_ _ This task comprises 45 items_ Each item involves the presenta_\ntion of _ve words from a common semantic category _e_g__ x_ y_ z_ w_v__ Subjects have to read the words aloud and memorize them_ Theyare then distracted with a simple addition or subtraction task_ Afterthis short interference task_ _ve words from the original seman_tic category are presented _e_g__ x_ y_ z_ a_ b__ Three words are thesame as in the previous trial_ and two are new and less frequent forthat category_ Subjects have to indicate which three words werepresent in the _rst series _no time limit__ The test score is the num_ber of correct responses_ the maximum score is 45 _3 points foreach 15 items__ In a preliminary study_ we showed that a cut_offscore of 40_45 _the lowest score obtained by a group of patientswith marked cerebral damage and severe amnesia_ was the bestthreshold to detect subjects asked to feign a memory de_cit _thesesubjects having a weaker score__\nIn addition to this speci_c task_ some index of simulation can\nalso be extracted from the WMT and the Doors tests_ Indeed_ IRand DR sub_tests from the WMT are particularly sensitive to lackof effort_ The consistency of the responses from IR to DR is calcu_lated_ This score allows investigation of lack of effort or simulation_The person receives a point if the correct response was chosen inthe two sub_tests or if the incorrect response was chosen in thetwo sub_tests and receives a score of zero if responses were incon_sistent for a given item_ scoring _correctly_ with some trials and_incorrectly_ with others_ The cut off score is _70__ Using this score_the performance of the subject can be questioned _42_ _ In the Doors\ntest_ the subject_s score is compared to chance performance_ Indeed_it is widely recognized that amnesic patients use implicit memory_or familiarity_ to recognize the target item_ and perform betterthan chance in most recognition tasks_ Hence_ if the subject_s per_formance is signi_cantly near to or less than that of chance _here25_ correct which is a score of 6_24__ the examiner may concludethat the examinee has intentionally chosen incorrect responses andmay have been motivated to perform inadequately _43_ _\n2_3_ Data analysis\nData were analyzed with Statistica 5_0_ The groups were com_\npared using a univariate analysis of variance _ANOVA__ The LSDtest or planned comparisons _post hoc comparisons_ were calcu_lated_ The statistical signi_cance for all of the analyses was set at__ _05_\n3_ Results\n3_1_ Depression_ anxiety and subjective fatigue\nFirst analyses of the questionnaires _see Table 2 _ showed a sig_\nni_cant main effect for each index_ Post hoc analysis suggested thatpatients with CFS were more depressed than controls on the BDIand GDS questionnaires_ but less depressed than the MDD group_The same pattern was observed for anxiety with patients withCFS being

depressive symptomatology or subjective fatigue_ and arethese potential associations the same as those present in patientswith MDD_ To answer these questions_ we evaluated correlationsbetween the main cognitive scores and BDI and GDS scores fordepression_ and FSS scores for subjective fatigue _ Table 4 __ Our\nresults clearly demonstrate that_ for patients with CFS_ surprisingly_there were no correlations between cognitive scores and subjectivefatigue_ and only a few correlations between the working memorydimension _measured by PASAT and WMT_ and depression_ withno correlations at all for other cognitive dimensions_ These resultscontrast with those of patients with MDD_ for whom there werestrong correlations between most cognitive scores and not only thedepression dimension but also subjective fatigue_ We also analyzedfor CFS patients whether scores on cognitive measures differedbetween the CFS patients with signi_cant depressive symptoms_GDS _11_ BDI _14_ and those CFS patients without the presence\nof depressive symptoms _GDS _ 11_ BDI _ 14__ We did not observeany signi_cant difference between the two groups_\n4_ Discussion\nIn this study_ we examined the performance of patients with CFS\nduring different cognitive tasks because there is still debate con_cerning the presence and interpretation of cognitive impairmentsin patients with CFS_ with some studies showing cognitive impair_ment and others not_ If there are cognitive de_cits in CFS patients_300 E_L_ Constant et al_ _ Clinical Neurology and Neurosurgery 113 _2011_ 295_302\nthe question is then to know whether these are core features of\nthe condition or an indirect consequence of other aspects of associ_ated comorbitities_ one of the most important being depression_ Inthis context_ the cognitive performances of patients with CFS werecompared with those of healthy controls_\nOur results clearly demonstrate cognitive impairment in\npatients with CFS and_ more importantly_ that it cannot beexplained by a lack of effort_ Indeed_ in terms of the subjects_involvement in the task_ we observed very good global perfor_mances not only for patients with MDD but also for those with CFS_Also_ importantly_ the cognitive impairments remained signi_cantafter the few patients who showed a lack of effort _ n_ 4 among a\ntotal of 50 patients_ were removed from our database_\nThe patients with CFS differed from the control group in several\naspects_ We observed that the patients with CFS were signi__cantly more anxious_ more depressed_ and more tired than thehealthy controls_ The overall results of the cognitive tests showedthat_ relative to healthy controls_ cognition was weaker among thepatients with CFS_ Analyses based on the group comparisons leadto the conclusion that the patients with CFS showed an impaired ormarkedly decreased ability to maintain attention and alertness_ Thepatients with CFS had slower phasic alertness_ They also showedimpairments in one working memory test _TEA_ and a tendency toimpairments in another _PASAT_ and in long_term memory _visualand verbal__ compared with the controls_\nHow can we interpret these cognitive impairments_ Are they\ndirectly linked to the pathophysiological mechanism of CFS or dothey re_ect an indirect consequence of the depressive symptomsoften observed in this condition_ Two arguments suggest that thecognitive de_cits in CFS are core symptoms of the condition and arenot the consequence of the depression dimension of the disorder_First_ when we compared the performances of patients with CFS andthose with MDD_ there were several differences_ the patients withCFS were signi_cantly less anxious and less depressed_ but morefatigued than the patients with MDD_ These results are in line withother papers_ Using the BDI_ Short et al_ _25_ and DeLuca et al_ _44_\nreported that subjects with CFS were more depressed than con_trols_ Cope et al_ _3_ and DeLuca et al_ _10_ _ on the other hand_ found\nthat subjects with CFS were less depressed than depressed patients_Using the STAI_ Riccio et al_ _8_and Cope et al_ _3_reported that there\nwere no differences between patients with CFS and controls_ How_ever_ DeLuca et al_ _10_ found that patients with CFS were more\nanxious than controls but less anxious than depressed subjects_similar to the results of the present study_ Finally_ the literaturealso reports that subjects with CFS are more tired than controls_44_45_ and more tired than depressed subjects _10_ _ For the cog_\nnitive tests_ patients with CFS and those with MDD also differed inseveral aspects_ There were three differences for the reaction timeand accuracy measures we used_ the patients with CFS were slowerin the TEA working memory test and obtained a better accuracyscore on the PASAT test than the patients with MDD_ It is also veryinteresting to note that patients with CFS were more impaired onthe long delay free recall of the WMT than patients with MDD_ Thisindex is probably the most sensitive for the detection of memorydif_culties_\nThe second argument for considering that cognitive de_cits\nare core symptoms of CFS comes from the correlation analyses_Although_ as expected_ cognitive impairments in patients with MDDwere strongly associated with depression and subjective fatigue_ inpatients with CFS we only observed_ _1_ a weak correlation betweenworking memory index and depression_ _2_ no correlation at allfor the other cognitive dimensions and depression_ and _3_ no cor_relation between cognitive measures and subjective fatigue_ Ourresults are in line with those of several authors _3_5_13_15_22_25_\nwho have shown that symptoms of depression do not correlate sig_ni_cantly with a variety of neuropsychological measures_ althoughother studies _6_7_11_17_21_ have reported such a correlation_ As\ndiscussed by others _23_ _ the fact that_ in this study_ MDD and CFS\npatients differed in several aspects is not surprising_ From a neu_robiological point of view_ there are also differences_ hypoactivityof the hypothalamic_pituitary_adrenal axis is usually observed inCFS_ in contrast to the hyperactivity of this axis in MDD _46_48_ _\nInterestingly_ in an atypical subtype of MDD _with hypersomnia_leaden paralysis_ mood reactivity_ interpersonal rejection sensitiv_ity__ hypoactivity of this axis is also observed _46_47_ _\nOur results show that globally the patients with CFS were no\nmore sensitive to suggestibility than the other two groups and_ infact_ were less suggestible than the patients with MDD_ Our resultsdo not replicate the _ndings of DiClementi et al_ _29_ _ who observed\nthat patients with CFS were more suggestible than controls on ameasure of general suggestibility _recall task of history_ and on thehypnotic induction pro_le _HIP_ _30_ _ The HIP is a brief structured\ntechnique that measures behavioural_ perceptual_ and cognitiveresponses to suggestions_ Subjects are asked to perform an eyeroll and then_ once their eyelids are closed_ the hypnotic inductioninvolves suggestions by the examiner of _oating and arm levita_tion_ In that study_ induction scores for the CFS group were higherthan those for controls_ It is important here to specify that sug_gestibility is not synonymous with gullibility_ Suggestibility refersto a type of information processing that is selective and distortedin that relevant information cannot be handled in a balanced fash_ion_ According to DiClementi et al_ _29_ _ _suggestible persons with\nCFS do experience the symptoms they report_ However_ a tendencyto focus on symptoms_ perhaps to the exclusion of other infor_mation_ may be related to CFS patients_ dif_culties in processingcomplex cognitive information_ and dif_culties with divided atten_tion_ _pp_ 684_685__ In line with this argument_ it is important tonote that although_ in our study_ patients with CFS were not moresuggestible than the two other groups_ there was a positive corre_lation between length of illness and the suggestibility index_ Thismay mean that the longer the CFS illness_ the more patients focuson their symptoms and if someone else focuses their attention ontheir symptoms_ they will show a greater response to that sugges_tion and this process will impair the realization of the cognitivetask in which they are involved_\nAs regards the impact of fatigue_ there were no signi_cant dif_\nferences among the three groups on the fatigue index_ These resultsare in line with the observations of most other authors _5_6_25_27_\nwho found no relationship between the level of fatigue in patientswith CFS and their performance on cognitive tests_ However_ Joyceet al_ _13_ did _nd one relationship between these parameters_\nIt is interesting to note that in another condition_ the post_poliosyndrome_ Ostlund et al_ _28_ also found no relationship between\ngeneral fatigue and cognitive de_cits_ However_ it is important toremember that the fact that we did not observe a direct effectof fatigue on cognitive variables does not mean that_ at the brainlevel_ the mental fatigue induced by our task did not have differ_ent consequences on brain activity in our three study populations_In a functional neuroimaging study_ Cook et al_ _49_ observed that_\ncompared with normal controls_ patients with CFS did not differin _nger tapping or auditory monitoring tasks _PASAT__ but exhib_ited signi_cantly greater activity in several cortical and subcorticalregions during the fatiguing cognitive task _PASAT__ In particular_compared to controls_ patients with CFS exhibited greater utiliza_tion of brain regions within the working memory system in orderto successfully complete the PASAT_ These results_ therefore_ sug_gest an association between subjective feelings of mental fatigueand brain responses during a fatiguing cognition_ Moreover_ thefact that_ in this study_ the objective effect of fatigue on cognitionwas not larger than in the two other groups does not mean that thesubjective impression of fatigue would not be higher in patientswith CFS_ Grafman et al_ _5_ investigated the relationship betweenE_L_ Constant et al_ _ Clinical Neurology and Neurosurgery 113 _2011_ 295_302 301\nthe subjective memory complaints of patients with CFS and their\nlevel of fatigue and found that there was evidence of a positiverelationship_\nFinally_ the present study has methodological issues that need to\nbe addressed_ First_ the MDD group did not strictly match the othergroups in years of education_ However_ we believe that this cannotexplain the results observed in the cognitive tests_ After adjustingfor years of education as covariates_ we observed the same resultsin the different cognitive tests_ Second_ maximum age in the CFSgroup was 55_ in the MDD group 68_ and in the control group 64_Especially for the MDD and control group there were some olderpersons included_ We know that aging has also a deteriorating effecton cognitive functioning although we do not think it would haveimpacted substantially the current outcomes_ Third_ the patientswith MDD were typically outpatients without atypical depressionor melancholic depression_ so the results of the present study can_not be extended to all types of patients with MDD_ Moreover_ itcould have been their _rst major depressive episode or a recur_rent one_ Some may argue that patients with recurrent depressiveepisodes are more at risk of cognitive impairments_ Fourth_ we usedtwo self_administered questionnaires _BDI and GDS_ to investigatedepression and not the Hamilton depression rating scale _HDRS_administered by a clinician_ Some may argue that subjectivity ismore often re_ected in the BDI scores than in the HDRS_ We choseto use self_administered questionnaires because two psychologistsparticipated in the evaluation of the patients and we wanted toavoid interjudge variability_ Moreover_ in the GDS_ physical symp_toms are excluded_ which is important for the assessment of thedepressive dimension in patients with CFS_ Fifth_ although the con_trols were not included if they were taking psychotropic drugs_ thiswas not the case for the patients with MDD or CFS_ and psychotropicdrugs may in_uence cognition_ Nevertheless_ it is almost impossibleto conduct such a study in drug naive patients and we can argue thatour patients are at least highly representative of patients seen indaily practice_ Finally_ it would have been interesting to investigatethe suggestibility and fatigue dimensions with more than one cog_nitive test_ It would have been interesting also to investigate othertypes of executive functions_ Future research in this _eld shouldalso compare cognition in subgroups with similar neurobiological_ndings_ for example_ patients with atypical MDD or CFS_\nIn conclusion_ the present study con_rms the presence of objec_\ntive impairment in attention and memory in patients with CFSbut with good mobilization of effort and without exaggerated sug_gestibility_\nFunding\nNo _nancial support was received for the work_\nCon_icts of interest\nThere are no con_icts of interest_\nReferences\n_1_ Fukuda K_ Straus SE_
