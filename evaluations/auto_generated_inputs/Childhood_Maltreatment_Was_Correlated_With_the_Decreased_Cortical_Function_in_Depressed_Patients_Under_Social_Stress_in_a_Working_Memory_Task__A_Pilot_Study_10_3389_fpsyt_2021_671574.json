adolescence are risk factors for early_onset MDD patients\n_55_56__ Besides_ childhood maltreatment can cause a series of\nphysiological and neurohumoral reactions_ including reduc ed\nvolumes in the prefrontal cortex _ 57__ and may lead individuals\nto being susceptible to depression _ 58_60__ Previous studies\nexhibited that the volumes of ventromedial PFC and rostral\nprefrontal cortex were reduced in children and adults who\nsu_ered from physical and sexual abuse _ 61_62__ Furthermore_\ncompared to individuals without childhood maltreatment_ th e\nactivity in the MPFC was decreased in individuals who su_ered\nfrom childhood maltreatment during emotional and neutral\nmemory encoding and recognition _ 22__ Meanwhile_ substance\nabuse and stress can bring about long_lasting changes bymodulating of gene expression or epigenetic mechanisms in the\nbrain_ and indeed an abnormal pattern of genome_wide DNA\nmethylation in APFC of subjects with alcohol use disorder _ 63__\nIn our study_ childhood sex abuse might disrupt the function\nof APFC in direct and indirect ways_ such as brain activation\nand DNA methylation_ and then contribute to the development\nofdepression_\nLIMITATIONS\nThere are several potential limitations in our study_ First_ the\nsample size was not large enough_ Therefore_ it was only a pilot\nstudy_ In the future_ we need to enlarge the sample to test\nand verify the current _ndings_ Second_ we did not distinguis h\nthe depression subtypes_ which might be the reason why there\nwas no correlation between the _estimations of peak voxel\nand the HAMD_17 score_ Therefore_ we need to investigate\nthe di_erences among di_erent subtypes of depression and\nstudy the relationship between clinical symptoms and
