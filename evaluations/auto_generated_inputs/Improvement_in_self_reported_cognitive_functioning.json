\nglobally_ This trend has been enhanced by the COVID_19 pandemic \n_1__ and the burden is in large part due to the high rates of relapse \nseen in MDD _ 2__ New episodes are linked with persisting residual \nsymptoms following affective remission including subthreshold \ndepressive symptoms_ fatigue_ sleep problems_ rumination_ and \ncognitive deficits _ 3__ contributing to relapse or recurrence and a \nmore severe courses of illness _ 4__ A large meta_analysis found small \nto large effects sizes for cognitive deficits in remitted MDD \npopulations_ measured objectively by neuropsychological tests_ \nacross most domains of cognitive functioning_ excluding  auditory \nattention_ general cognitive ability_ autobiographical memory_ in \naddition to inhibition unconstrained by speed _ 5__ In addition_ self_\nreported subjective cognitive difficulties _subjective deficits_ are \nprevalent in acute states of MDD _ 6__ and as residual cognitive \nsymptoms following MDD _ 7_ 8__ Subjective deficits are of clinical \nrelevance and are associated with lower quality of life and poorer \nfunctioning following MDD _ 9__ and could contribute to the \nalarming rate of relapse seen in MDD _ 10_ 11__ Perhaps surprisingly_ \nsubjective deficits show small associations to cognitive deficits \nmeasured by objective experimental and clinical neuropsychological \ntests _ 5_ 12_ A meta_analysis investigating the correlation between \nsubjective and objective measures of cognition found small \nsignificant associations between some measures_ with most \nconsistent effects between questionnaires measuring shifting and \ntests measuring shifting _ 13__ Some studies suggest that subjective \ncognition show associations to symptoms of MDD rather than to \nneuropsychological tests _ 14_ 15__ In the research literature objective \ncognitive tests performed in a controlled environment is \nrecommended as a measure of cognitive deficits in depression _ 16__ \nSelf_reported cognition could be_considered complementary to the \nperformance on objective cognitive tests and measure different \naspects of ecologically important _dys_function _ 12_ 17_19__ \nImportantly_ cognitive deficits are not fully remediated by \ntraditional treatments _ 20_ 21__ and a few interventions target \nresidual cognitive difficulties in the remitted phase of MDD_ \nincluding medication_ brain stimulation and cognitive remediation \n_22__ Little is known_ however_ about the long_term effects of \ninterventions targeting cognition following MDD_ as was evident \nby a recent meta_analysis _ 23__ There is also a lack of research \nreporting long_term outcomes in subjective cognitive deficits_ with \na few exceptions _ 24_28__ Overall_ the results from these studies \nreporting short_ and long_term outcomes have been mixed Thus_ \nexploring how new interventions influence subjective deficits over \ntime is of importance_\nAnother important residual cognitive symptom following \nMDD is rumination_ Rumination is an emotion regulation strategy \nwere one passively brood over self_related negative experiences \nand is hypothesized to be_related to deficits in working memory \n_WM_ for negative material_ sometimes termed hot_cognition  _26_ \n29_31__ Associations between objective cognitive tests and \nrumination are small_ but significant associations have been \nestablished for WM _ 3__ and subjective cognition _ 24__ Rumination \nis a central risk factor following remission of mood symptoms \n_32__ and predict relapse in remitted populations _ 4_ 33_ 34__ Thus_ \ndeficits in cognition are suspected to be_related to rumination_ however_ relationships to subjective deficits are unclear _ 24__ and \na recent review suggested that subjective deficits could cause \nrumination about not living up to one_s premorbid level_ and thus \nincrease relapse risk following MDD _ 19__ Interventions \nimproving cognition could thus reduce subjective deficits and \nrumination following MDD_ Interventions like computerized \nworking memory training _CWMT__ could result in improvement \nof residual cognitive symptoms following depression _ 10_ 23__ \nCWMT has been shown to improve objective cognitive functions \nlike executive functions and associations between rumination and \nWM for negative material _ 23_ 35__ Results are mixed regarding \nwhether interventions like CWMT improves rumination however_ \nwith studies finding support for improvements in some residual \nsymptoms like objective cognitive deficits_ but not all_ symptoms \nlike subjective cognitive deficits_ depressive symptoms_ and some \naspects of rumination _ 19_ 36_ 37__ Even less is known about \nsubjective deficits _ 19_ 25_ 26__ and the lasting effects of \ninterventions_ with preliminary reports suggesting long term \nimprovements in rumination and depressive symptoms_ but not \nsubjective deficits _ 25__ Given the high relapse rate and \nincremental relapse risk in MDD_ knowledge about the lasting \neffects of interventions targeting residual cognitive symptoms \nis vital_\nSupplying and accessing interventions targeting residual \nsymptoms in remission from MDD can be_challenging_ as there are \nlimited resources such as trained therapists in health care systems to \ndeliver targeted treatment_ particularly in remission _ 4__ One \npromising approach is to deliver pro_cognitive interventions digitally \nas this could increase access_ agency_ and reduce costs _ 38__ A strength \nwithin the research field is that many pro_cognitive interventions are \nalready delivered online or are computerized _ 23__ However_ digital \ndelivery might have implications for motivation and engagement _ 39__ \nIt has therefore been suggested that that sufficient guidance by \ntherapists can increase motivation and engagement _ 40__ In sum_ \ngiven limited studies in this area_ there is a need to further investigate \nthe long_term effects of on cost effective interventions on clinically \nrelevant residual cognitive symptom like subjective deficits \nand rumination_\nThe current study investigated the long_term effects of a \ncomprehensive digitally delivered CWMT intervention_ If CWMT \nimproves working memory _WM_ control for negative material in \nhot_cognition_ associated with rumination _ 35_ 41__ rumination would \ndecline over time following CWMT_ Ronold et_al_ _ 35_ investigated \nCWMT effects on hot_ and cold cognition_ rumination_ and depressive \nsymptoms and found significantly improved effects on the two former_ \nbut not the latter_ However_ WM improvements could generalize to \ndaily function_ e_g__ self_perceived cognitive function over time_ and a \nstudy found associations between subjective deficits and later quality \nof life and psychosocial function _ 9__ suggesting that long term \ndevelopment is important to investigate_ Also improvements over time \ncould reduce ruminative tendencies_ It was thus hypothesized that \nCWMT would yield durable effects in self_reported cognitive function \nand rumination_ The following research questions were investigated_\n_How does self_reported cognitive function _subjective deficits_ and \nrumination develop_two_year following CWMT_\n_Is CWMT improvement related to improvement in subjective \ndeficits or rumination_Ronold

training interventions _ 25__ This \ncould support better acceptability and feasibility of online tasks \ncompared to other interventions _ 10_ 26__ especially for long term \noutcomes for subjective cognition_\nRumination did not improve_ thus_ interventions targeting emotional \ninformation processing and hot cognition might be_more optimal_ Hot \ncognition involves cognitive control for emotional material _ 29__ and \ncould be_more related to depressive symptoms than classical tasks of \ncognitive and executive functions _ 44__ Alternatively_ the small sample was \nunderpowered to detect changes in rumination_ Hammar et_al_ _ 10__ for \ninstance_ reported that a subgroup improving from CWMT showed \ndecreased rumination_ Several studies have suggested that subgroups with \ndifferent cognitive profiles could exist in MDD _ 45_ 46__ and finding \nmoderators for personalization and optimalization of cognitive training \neffects are important for future research _ 47__ There are theoretical and \nempirical connections between WM and rumination _ 31__ with several \nauthors targeting this modality by cognitive training with various success \n_36__ Thus_ personalizing interventions and examine subgroups to identify \nthose who show_ and do not show benefits could be_important _ 47__ \nAlternatively_ or in addition_ rumination might show more connections \nto hot_cognition than cold_cognition _ 29_ 35_ 41_ 44__ and targeting _hot \ncognition_ could be_more effective in reducing rumination and affective \nresidual symptoms of depression _ 48__ Thus_ future studies should \ninvestigate the ability of digitally delivered interventions to target more \nbroadly_ including hot cognition and rumination_ and investigate the \nmechanisms of cognitive training on emotion regulation _ 37__ The weekly \ntherapist contact might have influenced results_ However_ since \nimprovements increased even 1 year after the intervention_ this could \nprobably not fully explain results_ The moderate association between \nimprovement in self_reported subjective cognitive difficulties and the \ntraining paradigm could suggest specific effects of WM training on self_\nreported cognitive functions in daily life and might thus represent an \nexample of far transfer effects_ or at least near transfer across domains_ \nFindings could be_relevant to relapse prevention because of this_ however \nmore methodological rigorous controlled studies should investigate \nthis further_\nStrengths_ limitations_ and suggestions for \nfuture research\nThis is the first study to report on the effects of digitally delivered \ncognitive enhancement interventions after two_years on residual cognitive \nsymptoms_ However_ sample sizes were small__ dropout considerable_ but \ncomparable to other studies in the literature _ 23_ 25__ There were no \ndifferences on demographic or outcome variables between those \ncompleting the intervention and dropping out at pre intervention_ \nhowever_ attrition effects cannot be_ ruled out_ and some participants \nmight have relapsed during training and follow up_ The study was \nunderpowered to detect small changes_ Thus_ acceptability could be_a \nchallenge in the current study_ Previous studies_ however_ suggested that \nthe current CWMT paradigm is both acceptable and feasible to use _ 10_ \n49__ No objective neuropsychological assessments of cognitive functions \nwere reported_ limiting generalizability to cognitive deficits on behavioral \ntasks_ However_ subjectively experienced cognitive difficulties could be_of \nclinical relevance in the remitted phase_ as it could be_associated with risk \nof depression relapse and poorer outcomes following MDD _ 19__ Another \nlimitation concerning outcome measures is not including a functional \ntransfer measure of cognitive effects_ which is recommended to investigate cognitive interventions generalizability _ 50__ Sample_ and demand \ncharacteristics could partly explain results_ and future studies should \ninvestigate factors related to drop out_ include more participants_ and \nimplement designs controlling for these variables_ In addition_ the \nincreasing improvements in subjective cognition over time suggested that \nit might take time for effects to generalize_ and thus longitudinal studies \nof cognitive remediation with longer follow up time might be_feasible_ \nHowever_ due to the high drop_out_ longitudinal studies with digital \nfollow up assessment might be_more optimal for acceptability following \nCWMT interventions_ and future longitudinal studies should plan \nfor this_\nConclusion\nA group completing digitally delivered CWMT showed reduced \nlevels of subjective cognitive deficits two_years following \nimplementation_ This shows significant promise in effective and \navailable relapse prevention strategies_ Thus_ the digitally delivered \nworking memory training shows promise in reducing subjective \ndifficulties following MDD_ and long_term effects of digitally delivered \ninterventions could be_comparable or supersede those seen in the \nlimited research on interventions delivered in the clinic_ However_ \ngiven the methodological qualities of the current study_ more \ncontrolled replication of results should be_ done_ There were no \nsignificant improvements in rumination_ underscoring the importance \nof continuing to develop interventions targeting important residual \nsymptoms like hot cognitive processes for optimal relapse
