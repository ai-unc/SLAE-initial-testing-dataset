This trend has been enhanced by the COVID_19 pandemic \n(1), and the burden is in large part due to the high rates of relapse \nseen in MDD ( 2). New episodes are linked with persisting residual \nsymptoms following affective remission including subthreshold \ndepressive symptoms, fatigue, sleep problems, rumination, and \ncognitive deficits ( 3), contributing to relapse or recurrence and a \nmore severe courses of illness ( 4). A large meta_analysis found small \nto large effects sizes for cognitive deficits in remitted MDD \npopulations, measured objectively by neuropsychological tests, \nacross most domains of cognitive functioning, excluding  auditory \nattention, general cognitive ability, autobiographical memory, in \naddition to inhibition unconstrained by speed ( 5). In addition, self_\nreported subjective cognitive difficulties (subjective deficits) are \nprevalent in acute states of MDD ( 6)_ and as residual cognitive \nsymptoms following MDD ( 7, 8). Subjective deficits are of clinical \nrelevance and are associated with lower quality of life and poorer \nfunctioning following MDD ( 9), and could contribute to the \nalarming rate of relapse seen in MDD ( 10, 11). Perhaps surprisingly, \nsubjective deficits show small associations to cognitive deficits \nmeasured by objective experimental and clinical neuropsychological \ntests ( 5, 12) A meta_analysis investigating the correlation between \nsubjective and objective measures of cognition found small \nsignificant associations between some measures, with most \nconsistent effects between questionnaires measuring shifting and \ntests measuring shifting ( 13). Some studies suggest that subjective \ncognition show associations to symptoms of MDD rather than to \nneuropsychological tests ( 14, 15). In the research literature objective \ncognitive tests performed in a controlled environment is \nrecommended as a measure of cognitive deficits in depression ( 16). \nSelf_reported cognition could be_considered complementary to the \nperformance on objective cognitive tests and measure different \naspects of ecologically important (dys)function ( 12, 17_19). \nImportantly, cognitive deficits are not fully remediated by \ntraditional treatments ( 20, 21), and a few interventions target \nresidual cognitive difficulties in the remitted phase of MDD, \nincluding medication, brain stimulation and cognitive remediation \n(22). Little is known, however, about the long_term effects of \ninterventions targeting cognition following MDD, as was evident \nby a recent meta_analysis ( 23). There is also a lack of research \nreporting long_term outcomes in subjective cognitive deficits, with \na few exceptions ( 24_28). Overall, the results from these studies \nreporting short_ and long_term outcomes have been mixed Thus, \nexploring how new interventions influence subjective deficits over \ntime is of importance.\nAnother important residual cognitive symptom following \nMDD is rumination. Rumination is an emotion regulation strategy \nwere one passively brood over self_related negative experiences \nand is hypothesized to be_related to deficits in working memory \n(WM) for negative material, sometimes termed hot_cognition  (26, \n29_31). Associations between objective cognitive tests and \nrumination are small, but significant associations have been \nestablished for WM ( 3), and subjective cognition ( 24). Rumination \nis a central risk factor following remission of mood symptoms \n(32), and predict relapse in remitted populations ( 4, 33, 34). Thus, \ndeficits in cognition are suspected to be_related to rumination, however, relationships to subjective deficits are unclear ( 24), and \na recent review suggested that subjective deficits could cause \nrumination about not living up to one_s premorbid level, and thus \nincrease relapse risk following MDD ( 19). Interventions \nimproving cognition could thus reduce subjective deficits and \nrumination following MDD. Interventions like computerized \nworking memory training (CWMT), could result in improvement \nof residual cognitive symptoms following depression ( 10, 23). \nCWMT has been shown to improve objective cognitive functions \nlike executive functions and associations between rumination and \nWM for negative material ( 23, 35). Results are mixed regarding \nwhether interventions like CWMT improves rumination however, \nwith studies finding support for improvements in some residual \nsymptoms like objective cognitive deficits, but not all, symptoms \nlike subjective cognitive deficits, depressive symptoms, and some \naspects of rumination ( 19, 36, 37). Even less is known about \nsubjective deficits ( 19, 25, 26), and the lasting effects of \ninterventions, with preliminary reports suggesting long term \nimprovements in rumination and depressive symptoms, but not \nsubjective deficits ( 25). Given the high relapse rate and \nincremental relapse risk in MDD, knowledge about the lasting \neffects of interventions targeting residual cognitive symptoms \nis vital.\nSupplying and accessing interventions targeting residual \nsymptoms in remission from MDD can be_challenging, as there are \nlimited resources such as trained therapists in health care systems to \ndeliver targeted treatment, particularly in remission ( 4). One \npromising approach is to deliver pro_cognitive interventions digitally \nas this could increase access, agency, and reduce costs ( 38). A strength \nwithin the research field is that many pro_cognitive interventions are \nalready delivered online or are computerized ( 23). However, digital \ndelivery might have implications for motivation and engagement ( 39). \nIt has therefore been suggested that that sufficient guidance by \ntherapists can increase motivation and engagement ( 40). In sum, \ngiven limited studies in this area, there is a need to further investigate \nthe long_term effects of on cost effective interventions on clinically \nrelevant residual cognitive symptom like subjective deficits \nand rumination.\nThe current study investigated the long_term effects of a \ncomprehensive digitally delivered CWMT intervention. If CWMT \nimproves working memory (WM) control for negative material in \nhot_cognition, associated with rumination ( 35, 41), rumination would \ndecline over time following CWMT. Ronold et_al. ( 35) investigated \nCWMT effects on hot_ and cold cognition, rumination, and depressive \nsymptoms and found significantly improved effects on the two former, \nbut not the latter. However, WM improvements could generalize to \ndaily function, e.g., self_perceived cognitive function over time, and a \nstudy found associations between subjective deficits and later quality \nof life and psychosocial function ( 9), suggesting that long term \ndevelopment is important to investigate. Also improvements over time \ncould reduce ruminative tendencies. It was thus hypothesized that \nCWMT would yield durable effects in self_reported cognitive function \nand rumination. The following research questions were investigated_\n_How does self_reported cognitive function (subjective deficits) and \nrumination develop_two_year following CWMT_\n_Is CWMT improvement related to improvement in subjective \ndeficits or rumination_Ronold et al. 10.3389_fpsyt.2023.1163073\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 03 frontiersin.orgMethods\nParticipants and procedure\nThis study is based on two_year data from an open pilot study \ninvestigating the effects of CWMT. Participants in the study were \nassessed pre, post, one_ and two_years after CWMT.\nRecruitment, participant flow\nTwenty_nine remitted participants assessed by the Montgomery \n_sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) ( 42) a score of _12, were \nincluded in the study initially [for more details see ( 35)]. Participants \nremained remitted at one and two_year follow up (MADRS score _ 12). \nOne participant was missing from the completers group at 1 year \nfollow_up. See Table_1  for demographical characteristics.\nCWMT intervention\nA commercial CWMT program, Cogmed _ was used for cognitive \ntraining. The program consisted of several number_, letter_, and spatial \nspan tasks with personalized, incremental difficulty. Participants worked \napproximately 40 min on different tasks each training day. The \ninterventions were delivered digitally , online, were participants logged on \nthrough computer or laptop, lasted approximately 5 weeks, with roughly \nfive days of training each week, and had weekly therapist guidance over \ntelephone discussing progress and potential obstacles with the training, such as motivational issues. See Hammar et_al. ( 10) for further description \nconcerning the paradigm and follow_up.\nEthics statement\nAll participants provided informed signed consent prior to \nparticipating in the respective studies. The study was conducted in \naccordance with the Helsinki declaration of Ethical Research regarding \nEthical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects \nand the approved by the committee for ethical research in Western \nNorway (2014_1079). Participants were compensated through free \naccess to the Cogmed _ platform and received a gift card \n(approximately 40_) at two_year follow up.\nOutcome_measures\nSubjective cognitive function\nParticipants completed an inventory of self_report measure of \ncognitive difficulties in executive functions (behavior rating inventory \nof executive function_adult version_ BRIEF_A) of which the 75 items \nglobal executive composite (GEC) was used to measure subjectively \nexperienced cognitive difficulties. Raw scores were used to investigate \nchanges, and high scores indicated poorer rating.\nRumination\nParticipants completed a 22_item self_report assessment of \nrumination, the Ruminative Responses Scale (RRS) to assess tendency \nfor rumination in response to sad mood.\nStatistical analyses and improvement \nscores\nAll analyses were run in the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences \n(SPSS_ version 28). Attrition was investigated through one way \nANOV A. Repeated measures ANOV A investigated changes in subjective \ncognitive function and rumination from pre_ to post intervention, 1 and \ntwo_year follow up. Paired sampled t_tests was used as follow up tests. \nPercent improvement in CWMT was calculated by the formula highest \nscore_starting score_starting score _ 100. Improvement scores were \ncalculated by subtracting pre scores from post (immediately after the \nintervention)_ and two_year follow up scores, so positive values \nrepresented improved scores, and bivariate correlations between CWMT \nand residual symptom improvement was calculated (Pearson_s r). Effect \nsizes was described as small, medium, and large according to Cohen ( 43). \nBecause of the small sample spaghetti plots showing the individual \ntrajectories in BRIEF (see Figure_1 ) and RRS (see Figure_2 ) were used to \nillustrate development of subjectively reported cognitive function \nand rumination.\nResults\nThere were no significant differences between completers and drop_\nouts on any of the clinical or demographic variables with small effects (see \nTable_ 1 ), suggesting limited attrition effects.

See \nFigures_ 1 , 2 for a graphical representation of individual changes in \nsubjective cognition and rumination. Correlation analyses suggested \nmedium correlations between subjective cognition and CWMT \nimprovement and subjective cognitive function both immediate and \ntwo_year following intervention, however these did not reach statistical \nsignificance p _ 0.05 (see Table_2 ).\nDiscussion\nLong term improvements on self_reported cognitive symptoms \nfollowing a digitally delivered CWMT intervention were found. Although the results must be_considered preliminary and uncertain \ndue to the small sample size and lack of control group, findings \nsupport the use of digitally delivered CWMT to improve subjective \ndeficits. In fact, the improvements in subjective cognition were even \nlarger compared to preliminary findings from long term follow up of \nFIGURE_1\nSpaghetti plot change in subjective cognition score over 2_years ( n___9).\nFIGURE_2\nSpaghetti plot of change in RRS score over 2_years ( n___8).Ronold et al. 10.3389_fpsyt.2023.1163073\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 05 frontiersin.orgin_person interventions  cognitive training interventions ( 25). This \ncould support better acceptability and feasibility of online tasks \ncompared to other interventions ( 10, 26), especially for long term \noutcomes for subjective cognition.\nRumination did not improve_ thus, interventions targeting emotional \ninformation processing and hot cognition might be_more optimal. Hot \ncognition involves cognitive control for emotional material ( 29), and \ncould be_more related to depressive symptoms than classical tasks of \ncognitive and executive functions ( 44). Alternatively, the small sample was \nunderpowered to detect changes in rumination. Hammar et_al. ( 10), for \ninstance, reported that a subgroup improving from CWMT showed \ndecreased rumination. Several studies have suggested that subgroups with \ndifferent cognitive profiles could exist in MDD ( 45, 46), and finding \nmoderators for personalization and optimalization of cognitive training \neffects are important for future research ( 47). There are theoretical and \nempirical connections between WM and rumination ( 31), with several \nauthors targeting this modality by cognitive training with various success \n(36). Thus, personalizing interventions and examine subgroups to identify \nthose who show_ and do not show benefits could be_important ( 47). \nAlternatively, or in addition, rumination might show more connections \nto hot_cognition than cold_cognition ( 29, 35, 41, 44), and targeting _hot \ncognition_ could be_more effective in reducing rumination and affective \nresidual symptoms of depression ( 48). Thus, future studies should \ninvestigate the ability of digitally delivered interventions to target more \nbroadly, including hot cognition and rumination, and investigate the \nmechanisms of cognitive training on emotion regulation ( 37). The weekly \ntherapist contact might have influenced results. However, since \nimprovements increased even 1 year after the intervention, this could \nprobably not fully explain results. The moderate association between \nimprovement in self_reported subjective cognitive difficulties and the \ntraining paradigm could suggest specific effects of WM training on self_\nreported cognitive functions in daily life and might thus represent an \nexample of far transfer effects, or at least near transfer across domains. \nFindings could be_relevant to relapse prevention because of this, however \nmore methodological rigorous controlled studies should investigate \nthis further.\nStrengths, limitations, and suggestions for \nfuture research\nThis is the first study to report on the effects of digitally delivered \ncognitive enhancement interventions after two_years on residual cognitive \nsymptoms. However, sample sizes were small_, dropout considerable, but \ncomparable to other studies in the literature ( 23, 25). There were no \ndifferences on demographic or outcome variables between those \ncompleting the intervention and dropping out at pre intervention, \nhowever, attrition effects cannot be_ ruled out, and some participants \nmight have relapsed during training and follow up. The study was \nunderpowered to detect small changes. Thus, acceptability could be_a \nchallenge in the current study. Previous studies, however, suggested that \nthe current CWMT paradigm is both acceptable and feasible to use ( 10, \n49). No objective neuropsychological assessments of cognitive functions \nwere reported, limiting generalizability to cognitive deficits on behavioral \ntasks. However, subjectively experienced cognitive difficulties could be_of \nclinical relevance in the remitted phase, as it could be_associated with risk \nof depression relapse and poorer outcomes following MDD ( 19). Another \nlimitation concerning outcome measures is not including a functional \ntransfer measure of cognitive effects, which is recommended to investigate cognitive interventions generalizability ( 50). Sample_ and demand \ncharacteristics could partly explain results, and future studies should \ninvestigate factors related to drop out, include more participants, and \nimplement designs controlling for these variables. In addition, the \nincreasing improvements in subjective cognition over time suggested that \nit might take time for effects to generalize, and thus longitudinal studies \nof cognitive remediation with longer follow up time might be_feasible. \nHowever, due to the high drop_out, longitudinal studies with digital \nfollow up assessment might be_more optimal for acceptability following \nCWMT interventions, and future longitudinal studies should plan \nfor this.\nConclusion\nA group completing digitally delivered CWMT showed reduced \nlevels of subjective cognitive deficits two_years following \nimplementation. This shows significant promise in effective and \navailable relapse prevention strategies. Thus, the digitally delivered \nworking memory training shows promise in reducing subjective \ndifficulties following MDD, and long_term effects of digitally delivered \ninterventions could be_comparable or supersede those seen in the \nlimited research on interventions delivered in the clinic. However, \ngiven the methodological qualities of the current study, more \ncontrolled replication of results should be_ done. There were no \nsignificant improvements in rumination, underscoring the importance \nof continuing to develop interventions targeting important residual \nsymptoms like hot cognitive processes for optimal relapse prevention.\nData availability statement\nThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will \nbe_made available by the authors, without undue reservation.\nEthics statement\nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and \napproved by The committee for ethical research in Western Norway \n(2014_1079).
