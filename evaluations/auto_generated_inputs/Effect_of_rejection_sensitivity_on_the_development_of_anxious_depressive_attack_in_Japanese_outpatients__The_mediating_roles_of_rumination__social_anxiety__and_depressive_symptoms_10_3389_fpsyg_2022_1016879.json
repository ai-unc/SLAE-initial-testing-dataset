2020 __ In addition_ \nrumination was shown to mediate the relationship between rejection \nsensitivity and social anxiety or depressive symptoms_ The \nrelationship between rejection sensitivity and rumination was \nsignificant_ but that between rumination and ADA was not_ \nTherefore_ we_consider that rumination is not directly associated \nwith ADA but is associated with depressive symptoms

mediate the effect \nof rejection sensitivity on depressive symptoms that trigger ADA_\nIn the present study_ the prevalence rates of ADA in all \nsubjects and in patients with atypical depression

many affected patients _ Noda et_al__ 2021 __ Therefore_ \nin patients with anxiety and depressive symptoms_ ADA should \nbe_identified as early as possible_ In this study_ rejection sensitivity \nand

ADA_\nFurthermore_ this model suggests that rejection sensitivity is an \nimportant predictor of ADA_ Therefore_ interventions targeting \nrejection sensitivity should be_implemented in the management and \nprevention of ADA_ Mindfulness training may be_ an option for \ntreating ADA_ Trait mindfulness is negatively associated with \nrejection sensitivity _ Sheng et_ al__ 2022 __ In particular_ the \nnonjudgment factor of trait mindfulness negatively predicts rejection \nsensitivity _ Peters et_al__ 2016 __ Keng and Tan _2018_  demonstrated \nthat brief mindfulness training is effective in

symptoms _ Deyo et_al__ 2009 _ \nGoldin and Gross_ 2010 __ These findings suggest that mindfulness \ntraining may be_an effective intervention for ADA_\nThis study has several limitations_ First_ a longitudinal design \nshould be_ used to assess the associations among the variables \naddressed in this study to validate a causal relationship_ In the model \nthat we_constructed_ the direction of causality was assumed based on \nthe results of previous studies_ and its validity was examined_ However_ \na cross_sectional design was used in this study_ thus_ the causal \nrelationships among these variables could not be_established_ Second_ \nthis study was conducted in a specialized clinic for anxiety and \ndepression_ Because most patients visiting this clinic present with \nanxiety and depressive disorders_ the possibility exists that the results \nmay have been biased_ Future studies should be_conducted in hospitals \nand clinics that specialize in a wide range of mental illnesses_ Third_ patients who visited the clinic for the first time were included in this \nstudy_ and the eligibility criteria included patients treated with and \nwithout pharmacotherapy_ The model should be_assessed separately \nfor patients treated with pharmacotherapy and patients who were not \ntreated with pharmacotherapy_ Finally_ the development of ADA \nshould be_ further tested_ Adverse childhood experiences and \nchildhood emotional abuse_maltreatment are associated with rejection \nsensitivity_ rumination_ and clinical symptoms _ Chesin et_al__ 2015 _ \nPierce et_al__ 2018 _ Mansueto et_al__ 2021 __ A model showing the effects \nof rejection sensitivity on ADA could be_established in the future_\nConclusion\nThis study provides preliminary evidence suggesting that \nrumination_ social anxiety symptoms_ and depressive symptoms \nmediate the effect of rejection sensitivity on the development of \nADA_ This evidence is an impetus for future research to
