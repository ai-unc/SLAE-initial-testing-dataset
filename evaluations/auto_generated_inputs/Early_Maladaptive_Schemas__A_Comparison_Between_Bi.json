A vast amountof research point to essential differences between the two\nmood disorders, now termed bipolar disorder (BD) and\nmajor depressive disorder (MDD), including different agesof onset, depressive symptomatology and medicationresponses (Goodwin _ Jameson, 2007). However, evidencepointing to genetic co_heritability between the two disor_ders (Kendler et al., 2013) and one_third of MDD patients\nconverting into BD patients (Dudek et al., 2013) indicate\nnebulous boundaries and an area in need of furtherelucidation.A hallmark of mood disorders is abnormal self_evaluation\nas manifested by in _ated and de _ated perceptions of self\nduring mania and depression, respectively. Abnormalities\nin self_evaluation are, however, not con _ned to mood\nepisodes but also manifest during remitted illness phasesof MDD and BD as evinced by lower self_esteem (Nilssonet al., 2010b) and higher self_compartmentalization (Alatiq,\nCrane, Williams, _ Goodwin, 2010_ Taylor, Morley, _ Bar_ton, 2007). Yet, little is known about the speci _ct h e m e s\nand patterns of self_conception in mood disorders duringremission. The schema theory developed by Young, Kloskoand Weishaar (2003), which contains an operationalizedmodel of self_conceptual themes associated with psychopa_thology and dysfunction, provides a heuristic frameworkfor examining differences between MDD and BD in thisdomain. The key concept within this theory is the earlymaladaptive schema (EMS) de _ned as a broad, pervasive\ntheme or pattern comprised of memories, emotions, cognitionsand bodily sensations regarding oneself and one _s relationship with\nothers developed during childhood or adolescence elaboratedthroughout one _s lifetime and dysfunctional to a signi _cant degree\n(Young et al., 2003, p. 7). In cognitive models of psychopa_\nthology, schemas are considered the deepest level of\n_Correspondence to_ Kristine Kahr Nilsson, Center for Developmental\nand Applied Psychological Science (CeDAPS), the Department of\nCommunication and Psychology, Aalborg University, Denmark.E_mail_ kkn_hum.aau.dkClinical Psychology and Psychotherapy\nClin.

In theschema theory, on the other hand, EMSs are conceptualizedas pervasive, ego_syntonic and highly accessible (Rafaeli,Bernstein, _ Young, 2011_ Young et al., 2003) and therefore\ndo not require stress_activation or priming in order to be\naccessed and measured. Due to these characteristics,\nEMSs appear relevant to consider as persistent patternsin_uencing the remitted illness phases of BD and MDD.\nThus far, research into EMSs in mood disorders is\nlimited. The few studies on the topic indicate that EMSsoverall are more severe in mood disorder patientscompared with controls (Ak et al., 2012_ Halvorsen, Wang,\nEisemann, _ Waterloo, 2010_ Hawke _ Provencher, 2012_Nilsson et al., 2010a). In the only study comparing BD\nand MDD in terms of EMSs, Hawke and Provencher(2012) found that, compared with MDD patients, BDpatients had signi _cantly higher scores on two EMSs_\nentitlement and approval seeking. This study points EMSdifferences between the two mood disorders. However,since remission was not an inclusion criterion, the _ndingsdo not extrapolate to remitted illness phases of the two\nmood disorders. Since mood symptoms can in _uence\nmeasurement, it is important to account for the effects ofmood such as by using a remission design in which remissionis an inclusion criterion. Thus, to elucidate this topic, thepresent study employed a remission design that comparedBD and MDD in terms of EMSs during remission.\nMETHODS\nSample\nThe sample consisted of two mood disorder cohorts whichhave been used for other research purposes in previouslypublished studies (Halvorsen et al., 2009_ Halvorsen et al.,\n2010_ Nilsson, 2012_ Nilsson et al., 2010a). The inclusion\ncriteria were a diagnosis of either MDD or BD and currentremission de _ned as the absence of major affective episodes\nestablished by clinical interviews. The procedures and mea_sures are described in earlier publications (Halvorsen et al.,\n2009_ Halvorsen et al., 2010_ Nilsson, 2012_ Nilsson et al.,\n2010a). The participants with MDD were furthermorerequired to have at least two past depressive episodesin order to match the minimum number of affectiveepisodes required for a diagnosis of BD according tothe diagnostic criteria of ICD_10 (WHO, 1993).\nThe data were collected in two sites in Scandinavia_ The\nUniversity Clinic at the University of Troms_, Norway,\nTable 1.

The merged sample consisted of 30participants with MDD and 49 participants with BD.\nMeasure\nThe short version of the Young Schema Questionnaire(YSQ_S2_ Young, 1998) was used to measure 15 differentEMSs outlined in Table 1. The YSQ_S2 is a self_reportquestionnaire which requests the respondents to rate 75statements on a Likert Scale ranging from 1 _ _completely\nuntrue of me _to 6 _ _describes me perfectly _. The psycho_\nmetric properties of the YSQ_S2 have been supported inprior research in terms of internal consistency, factor struc_ture and convergent validity (e.g., Calvete, Est_vez, L_pezde Arroyabe, _ Ruiz, 2005_ Hoffart et al., 2005_ Welburn\net al., 2002). The schema domains, which describe catego_\nries of EMSs de _ned by their developmental origins\n(Young et al., 2003), were not analysed as higher order\ndimensions due to inconsistent support of their factorialvalidity (Calvete et al., 2005_ Hoffart et al., 2005_ Levente\net al., 2012).\nData Analysis\nStatistical analyses were performed using the Statistical\nPackage for the Social Sciences _Version 19.0 (SPSS, Inc.,\nChicago, USA). To examine between_group differences,t_tests were used for continuous variables and chi_square\nanalyses for categorical variables. Estimates of thesubscales _internal consistencies were assessed through\nCronbach _s alpha coef _cients.\nRESULTS\nDescriptive and inferential statistics are presented in\nTable 2. The percentage of women was signi _cantly higher\nin the MDD group compared with the BD group. However,the only EMS in which a sex difference emerged was entitle_ment with men scoring signi _cantly higher than women\n(t_2 . 8 7 , p_ 0.005). The use of psychopharmacological\ntreatments was signi _cantly more prevalent in the BDgroup compared with the MDD group. Within the MDD\ngroup, there were no signi _cant differences in EMS scores\nbetween participants who received psychopharmacologicaltreatments and participants who did not. Similar compari_sons could not be made within the BD group since onlyone participant was not on medication. There was no signif_icant age difference between the BD group and the MDD\ngroup. The Cronbach _s alpha coef _cients indicated that\nmost of the EMS subscales had adequate internal consisten_cies (Table 3). However, vulnerability to harm and illnessand enmeshment had coef _cients slightly below 0.70 and\nshould therefore be interpreted with caution. The t_tests\n(Table 3) revealed that the BD group scored signi _cantly\nhigher than the MDD group on seven EMSs_ abandonment,failure to achieve, and insuf _cient self_control, subjugation,\nunrelenting standards, enmeshment and entitlement. Thedifferences on entitlement remained signi _cant when con_\ntrolling for the identi _ed sex difference ( t_4 . 4 5 , p_0 . 0 0 0 ) .\nAn additional three EMSs were elevated in BD comparedwith MDD at a near_signi _cant level_ mistrust, social isola_\ntion and dependence (Table 3).\nTable 2.

The results revealed that the BD group\nscored higher than the MDD group on most of the EMS\nscales, and for seven EMSs, the differences were statisticallysigni_cant_ abandonment, failure to achieve, insuf _cient\nself_control, subjugation, unrelenting standards, enmesh_\nment and entitlement. These _ndings extends previous\n_ndings by Hawke and Provencher (2012) by suggesting\nthat EMSs also tend to be more severe in BD compared withMDD during remission.\nThe_ndings may be interpreted through a schema\ntheory lens. According to Young et al. (2003), temperamental\ndispositions interact with need_thwarting or traumatic earlylife experiences in the formation of EMSs. Studies suggestthat BD, compared with MDD, is associated with morechildhood traumas (Hyun, Friedman, _ Dunner, 2000) andtemperamental dysregulation (Matsumoto et al ., 2005_\nNowakowska et al., 2005_ Savitz, van der Merwe, _\nRamesar, 2008). Thus, a higher prevalence of the pro_posed origins of EMSs in BD may explain the greaterEMS severity in this disorder compared with MDD.Moreover, since EMSs purportedly continue their forma_tions in adulthood (Young et al., 2003), the illness course\nof mood disorder may be assumed to play a role in their\nformation. Compared with MDD, BD is characterizedby more frequent depres sive episodes (Forty et al., 2008),\nmore comorbid anxiety disorders and personality disor_ders (Moreno et al., 2012) and an earlier illness onset\n(Tondo, Lepri, Cruz, _ Baldessarini, 2010_ Weissmanet al., 1996). A more pervasive illness course in BD may\nbe conceived as having detrimental effects that contributeto the higher EMS severity in this group compared withMDD.\nThe_ndings may be considered in terms of their clinical\nimplications. Schema therapy (ST_ Young et al., 2003), a\npsychotherapeutic treatment which speci _cally targets\nEMSs, has been found to have comparable ef _cacy with\ncognitive behaviour therapy in the treatment of MDD(Carter et al., 2013). Considering the higher EMS severity\nin BD compared with MDD, as indicated by the presentstudy, it is pertinent to contemplate whether ST wouldhave additional treatment effects if applied to BD. Hawke,\nProvenche, and Parikhb (2013) have proposed a modi _ed\nversion of ST for BD which emphasizes mood stabilizationand prevention of affective relapses and recurrences. Thus,the effects of ST tailored the symptomatology of BD seemrelevant to investigate in future treatments studies.\nA number of methodological drawbacks need to be con_\nsidered when interpreting the _ndings. First, as described\nelsewhere (Halvorsen et al., 2009_ Halvorsen et al., 2010_\nNilsson, 2012_ Nilsson et al., 2010a), the assessment proce_\ndures used at two data_collection sites differed with regardto speci _c symptom measures and initial recruitmentstrategies. The present _ndings should therefore be consid_\nered provisional and in need of further replication. Second,due to the cross_sectional design, the present study did notprovide any insights into causal mechanisms underlyingEMSs in the two mood disorders. The development ofEMSs in mood disorders therefore remains to be eluci_dated by longitudinal research.\nIn conclusion, by suggesting that EMSs overall are more\nsevere in BD compared with MDD during remission, the_ndings elaborate the understanding of differences be_\ntween the two mood disorders. Moreover, the _ndings\nhighlight potential vulnerabilities in BD, which meritfurther investigation in terms of their underlying causesand potential treatment implications.\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST\nThe authors do not have any commercial associationwhich might pose a con _ict of interest in connection with\nthe manuscript.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nThis study was partially made possible through fundinggranted to the _rst author from Aarhus University, Denmark.\nA n o t h e rp a r to ft h i ss t u d yw a ss u p p o r t e db yt h eN a t i o n a lProgram of Integrated Clinical Specialists and PhD trainingfor Psychologist in Norway and the Psychiatric ResearchCentre of Northern Norway.
