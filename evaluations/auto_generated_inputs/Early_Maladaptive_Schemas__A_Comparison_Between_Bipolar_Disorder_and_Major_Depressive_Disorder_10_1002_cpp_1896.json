modern\npsychiatry _Krapelin_ 1921_ Leonhard_ 1957__ it has beenwidely debated whether unipolar and bipolar mooddisorders represent distinct disease entities or differentsubtypes within a mood disorder spectrum_ A vast amountof research point to essential differences between the two\nmood disorders_ now termed bipolar disorder _BD_ and\nmajor depressive disorder _MDD__ including different agesof onset_ depressive symptomatology and medicationresponses _Goodwin _ Jameson_ 2007__ However_ evidencepointing to genetic co_heritability between the two disor_ders _Kendler et al__ 2013_ and one_third of MDD patients\nconverting into BD patients _Dudek et al__ 2013_ indicate\nnebulous boundaries and an area in need of furtherelucidation_A hallmark of mood disorders is abnormal self_evaluation\nas manifested by in _ated and de _ated perceptions of self\nduring mania and depression_ respectively_ Abnormalities\nin self_evaluation are_ however_ not con _ned to mood\nepisodes but also manifest during remitted illness phasesof MDD and BD as evinced by lower self_esteem _Nilssonet al__ 2010b_ and higher self_compartmentalization _Alatiq_\nCrane_ Williams_ _ Goodwin_ 2010_ Taylor_ Morley_ _ Bar_ton_ 2007__ Yet_ little is known about the speci _ct h e m e s\nand patterns of self_conception in mood disorders duringremission_ The schema theory developed by Young_ Kloskoand Weishaar _2003__ which contains an operationalizedmodel of self_conceptual themes associated with psychopa_thology and dysfunction_ provides a heuristic frameworkfor examining differences between MDD and BD in thisdomain_ The key concept within this theory is the earlymaladaptive schema _EMS_ de _ned as a broad_ pervasive\ntheme or pattern comprised of memories_ emotions_ cognitionsand bodily sensations regarding oneself and one _s relationship with\nothers developed during childhood or adolescence elaboratedthroughout one _s lifetime and dysfunctional to a signi _cant degree\n_Young et

information pro_\ncessing that guide thinking and behaviours _Wright_ 2006__EMSs refer to schemas with early developmental originswhich are highly self_perpetuating and maladaptive hencecausing considerable distress and dysfunction_\nIn earlier cognitive theories of mood disorders_ negative\nself_schemas were conceptualized as latent cognitive struc_tures which needed to be primed by mood or triggered byparticular life events in order to be activated _Ingram_Miranda_ _ Segal_ 1998_ Kovacs _ Beck_ 1978__ In theschema theory_ on the other hand_ EMSs are conceptualizedas pervasive_ ego_syntonic and highly accessible _Rafaeli_Bernstein_ _ Young_ 2011_ Young et al__ 2003_ and therefore\ndo not require stress_activation or priming in order to be\naccessed and measured_ Due to these characteristics_\nEMSs appear relevant to consider as persistent patternsin_uencing the remitted illness phases of BD and MDD_\nThus far_ research into EMSs in mood disorders is\nlimited_ The few studies on the topic indicate that EMSsoverall are more severe in mood disorder patientscompared with controls _Ak et al__ 2012_ Halvorsen_ Wang_\nEisemann_ _ Waterloo_ 2010_ Hawke _ Provencher_ 2012_Nilsson et al__ 2010a__ In the only study comparing BD\nand MDD in terms of EMSs_ Hawke and Provencher_2012_ found that_ compared with MDD patients_ BDpatients had signi _cantly higher scores on two EMSs_\nentitlement and approval seeking_ This study points EMSdifferences between the two mood disorders_ However_since remission was not an inclusion criterion_ the _ndingsdo not extrapolate to remitted illness phases of the two\nmood disorders_ Since mood symptoms can in _uence\nmeasurement_ it is important to account for the effects ofmood such as by using a remission design in which remissionis an inclusion criterion_ Thus_ to elucidate this topic_ thepresent study employed a remission design that comparedBD and MDD in terms of EMSs during remission_\nMETHODS\nSample\nThe sample consisted of two mood disorder cohorts whichhave been used for other research purposes in previouslypublished studies _Halvorsen et al__ 2009_ Halvorsen et al__\n2010_ Nilsson_ 2012_ Nilsson et al__ 2010a__ The inclusion\ncriteria were a diagnosis of either MDD or BD and currentremission de _ned as the absence of major affective episodes\nestablished by clinical interviews_ The procedures and mea_sures are described in earlier publications _Halvorsen et al__\n2009_ Halvorsen et al__ 2010_ Nilsson_ 2012_ Nilsson et al__\n2010a__ The participants with MDD were furthermorerequired to have at least two past depressive episodesin order to match the minimum number of affectiveepisodes required for a diagnosis of BD according tothe diagnostic criteria of ICD_10 _WHO_ 1993__\nThe data were collected in two sites in Scandinavia_ The\nUniversity Clinic at the University of Troms__ Norway_\nTable 1_ Brief descriptions of the measured early maladaptive schemas\nEMS Content\nEmotional deprivation The belief that one _s desire for emotional support and guidance will not be met by others_\nAbandonment The belief that others will be unpredictable and eventually leave_\nMistrust The

community_\nDefectiveness The belief that one is defective_ unlovable and inferior to others_Failure to achieve The belief that one is determined to be an underachiever and that one\nhas failed and will inevitable fail_\nDependence The belief that one is dependent upon others to manage everyday responsibilities_\nVulnerability to harm The belief that unpreventable catastrophes or harm may strike at any time_\nEnmeshment The perception of being smothered by or fused with others at the cost of individual\nidentity and development_\nSubjugation The belief that one _s feelings and opinions are not important and that one must obey\nothers _wishes in order to avoid anger or rejection_\nSelf_sacri _ce The belief that one must meet the needs of others at all times even if it is at the\nexpense of one _s own needs_\nEmotional inhibition An excessive focus on inhibiting emotional expression in order to avoid humiliation\nand disapproval by others_\nUnrelenting standards The belief that one must meet high internalized standards of performance in order to\navoid criticism_\nEntitlement The belief that one is superior to others and hence should be entitled to special rights_\nInsuf_cient self_control The belief that one is unable to control oneself and unable to tolerate discomfort for the\nsake of achieving long_term goals_388 K_ K_ Nilsson et al_\nCopyright _ 2014 John Wiley _ Sons_

compared EMSs between BD and MDD\nduring remission_ The results revealed that the BD group\nscored higher than the MDD group on most of the EMS\nscales_ and for seven EMSs_ the differences were statisticallysigni_cant_ abandonment_ failure to achieve_ insuf _cient\nself_control_ subjugation_ unrelenting standards_ enmesh_\nment and entitlement_ These _ndings extends previous\n_ndings by Hawke and Provencher _2012_ by suggesting\nthat EMSs also tend to be more severe in BD compared withMDD during remission_\nThe_ndings may be interpreted through a schema\ntheory lens_ According to Young et al_ _2003__ temperamental\ndispositions interact with need_thwarting or traumatic earlylife experiences in the formation of EMSs_ Studies suggestthat BD_ compared with MDD_ is associated with morechildhood traumas _Hyun_ Friedman_ _ Dunner_ 2000_ andtemperamental dysregulation _Matsumoto et al __ 2005_\nNowakowska et al__ 2005_ Savitz_ van der Merwe_ _\nRamesar_ 2008__ Thus_ a higher prevalence of the pro_posed origins of EMSs in BD may explain the greaterEMS severity in this disorder compared with MDD_Moreover_ since EMSs purportedly continue their forma_tions in adulthood _Young et al__ 2003__ the illness course\nof mood disorder may be assumed to play a role in their\nformation_ Compared with MDD_ BD is characterizedby more frequent depres sive episodes _Forty et al__ 2008__\nmore comorbid anxiety disorders and personality disor_ders _Moreno et al__ 2012_ and an earlier illness onset\n_Tondo_ Lepri_ Cruz_ _ Baldessarini_ 2010_ Weissmanet al__ 1996__ A more pervasive illness course in BD may\nbe conceived as having detrimental effects that contributeto the higher EMS severity in this group compared withMDD_\nThe_ndings may be considered in terms of their clinical\nimplications_ Schema therapy _ST_ Young et al__ 2003__ a\npsychotherapeutic treatment which speci _cally targets\nEMSs_ has been found to have comparable ef _cacy with\ncognitive behaviour therapy in the treatment of MDD_Carter et al__ 2013__ Considering the higher EMS severity\nin BD compared with MDD_ as indicated by the presentstudy_ it is pertinent to contemplate whether ST wouldhave additional treatment effects if applied to BD_ Hawke_\nProvenche_ and Parikhb _2013_ have proposed a modi _ed\nversion of ST for BD which emphasizes mood stabilizationand prevention of affective relapses and recurrences_ Thus_the effects of ST tailored the symptomatology of BD seemrelevant to investigate in future treatments studies_\nA number of methodological drawbacks need to be con_\nsidered when interpreting the _ndings_ First_ as described\nelsewhere _Halvorsen et al__ 2009_ Halvorsen et al__ 2010_\nNilsson_ 2012_ Nilsson et al__ 2010a__ the assessment proce_\ndures used at two data_collection sites differed with regardto speci _c symptom measures and initial recruitmentstrategies_ The present _ndings should therefore be consid_\nered provisional and in need of further replication_ Second_due to the cross_sectional design_ the present study did notprovide any insights into causal mechanisms underlyingEMSs in the two mood disorders_ The development ofEMSs in mood disorders therefore remains to be eluci_dated by longitudinal research_\nIn conclusion_ by suggesting that EMSs overall are more\nsevere in BD compared with MDD during remission_ the_ndings elaborate the understanding of differences be_\ntween the two mood disorders_ Moreover_ the _ndings\nhighlight potential vulnerabilities in BD_ which meritfurther investigation in terms of their underlying causesand potential treatment implications_\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST\nThe authors do not have any commercial associationwhich might pose a con _ict of interest in connection with\nthe
