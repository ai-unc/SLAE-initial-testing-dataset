that depressive ru_\nmination is connected to cognitive impairments in MDD_ It is discussed as an important underlying cognitive mechanism_ However_ there is little understanding of the extent to which rumination influences cognitive perfor_mance_ especially in single domains_\n  Rumination and Cognitive Impairments  \n Resource allocation theory posits that rumination ab_\nsorbs cognitive capacities which can thus not be directed towards task_relevant processes  \n_11_13_  _ According to \nthis theory_ valuable cognitive resources are allocated to irrelevant depressive and ruminative thought processes_ Indeed_ there are many findings that support the link be_tween reduced cognitive performance and rumination as put forward in the dual_process model of cognitive vul_nerability in depressed persons_ According to this model_ the ability of depressed individuals to implement correc_tive reflective processing in order to overcome automatic negative biases is impaired_ because this processing re_quires effort and cognitive resources that are not available  \n_14_ _ Thus_ rumination might reduce  cognitive flexibility   \nand raise interference levels above a critical threshold_ In line with these results_ Davis and Nolen_Hoeksema  \n_15_  \nshowed that participants who scored high on a self_report measure of ruminative style made more perseverative er_rors than nonruminators in the Wisconsin card sorting test_ a widely used measure of  executive control   and  cogni_\ntive flexibility  _\n  In addition_ the dual_process model posits that the \ncognitive resources of depressed individuals might al_ready be strained by competing mood_congruent and ru_minative thought processes  \n_14_ _ In particular the brood_\ning_ maladaptive component of rumination has been found to be associated with higher negative  attentional \nbiases    \n_16_ _ suggesting that depressed individuals with \nhigh levels of brooding have tightly connected negative schemata from which they have difficulty in breaking away_ Some scholars_ on the other hand_ have related ru_mination to major deficits in  cognitive control  _ regardless \nof the valence of the processed material_ Specifically_ ru_minators are thought to exhibit an impaired ability to flexibly shift  attention   or  inhibit  irrelevant information \n_e_g_  \n15 _  17 __  Previous research has also reported that rumination is \nrelated to  memory deficits   and  memory biases   _18_ 19_  _ For \nexample_ when people are asked to recall memories of specific autobiographical events_ depressed patients are more likely to retrieve overgeneral_ categorical memories that are summaries of repeated occasions than controls _for a review_ see  \n20 __ Watkins et al_  _21_  found that the \ndistraction induction _as a composite of rumination in_duction_ significantly reduced overgeneral memory at preinduction levels_ \n  Rumination has also been associated with  working \nmemory   deficits_ Joormann and Gotlib  \n_22_  proved a link \nbetween rumination_ impaired  working memory_   and de_\npression_ They found that the interference of negative ir_relevant words was correlated with self_reported rumina_tion_ This relation with rumination was limited to the MDD group and remained significant even after partial_ing out the level of depressive symptomatology_ the high_er the participants_ scored for the self_reported measure of rumination_ the greater their difficulty in removing task_irrelevant negative content from their working memory_ The connection between rumination and im_paired working memory was also reported by other au_thors  \n_23_ 24_  _\n  There have also been several experimental research \nstudies on the effect of induced rumination on  executive \nfunctions   _e_g_  25_27  __ In the study by Watkins and Brown \n _13_ _ for example_ the performance of depressed patients \nand nondepressed controls was compared for a random number generation task_ performed after either a rumina_tion or a distraction induction_ Compared with the dis_traction induction_ the rumination induction produced a significant increase in stereotyped counting responses _reflecting a failure of inhibitory executive control_ in de_pressed patients but not in controls_ However_ after dis_traction_ no difference was found between the 2 groups_ The authors concluded that the rumination induction may interfere with concurrent executive processing_\n  In sum_ findings from the studies reviewed above ten_\ntatively support a connection between rumination and deficits in cognitive performance_ However_ previous re_search on the impact of rumination on cognitive impair_ments in MDD has a number of shortcomings and has left open questions of which 3 seem especially important_ \n  Previous studies reported the influence of ruminative \nthinking on memory_ attention_ or executive functions_ However_ most studies have assessed only 1 or very few aspects of the specific domains such as

many studies on rumination and cogni_\ntive dysfunctions have not controlled for the influence of other factors such as the severity of depression_ the amount of depressive episodes in the past_ medication or duration of the current episode_ Previous research has shown that these factors can strongly influence the extent of cognitive deficits in MDD  \n_28_ _ Moreover_ it seems es_\nsential to control for general factors such as age_ patients_ intelligence_ or level of education  \n_29_ _ However_ these \nfactors have not been taken into consideration so far_ \n  Previous investigations have also failed to explore the \nrelationship between rumination in everyday life and cognitive performance_ Most studies have assessed the in_fluence of rumination in an experimental design_ which required participants to complete several cognitive tasks after introducing rumination_ Therefore_ it stands to rea_son that rumination induced shortly before examination has an impact on the ability to solve cognitive tasks_ How_ever_ it is unclear as to whether depressive patients who ruminate a lot about themselves and their diseases in ev_eryday life also exhibit higher cognitive impairments than depressive patients whose tendency to ruminate in every_day life is not as pronounced_\n  The current study aims at answering the above_men_\ntioned questions_ thus closing a gap in research by

impairments in \nMDD are linked to rumination in the domain of process_ing speed_ This was the only cognitive domain that was influenced by rumination after including other predic_tors in the hierarchical regression analysis_ To our knowl_edge_ there has been no previous research on the impact of rumination on processing speed_ This is_ however_ a basic cognitive domain which affects cognitive perfor_mance in general_ In line with these results_ previous stud_ies have suggested that cognitive impairments in depres_sion may be mediated in part or wholly by more basic deficits such as processing speed _e_g_  \n37_39  __ These stud_\nies did not_ however_ examine the influence of rumination in this context_ It seems that rumination could be an un_derlying mechanism for the connection between process_ing speed and cognitive impairments in MDD_ Further research is needed to assess this relationship and to gen_eralize the findings if possible_\n  Furthermore_ our findings are partially consistent with \nthe results of Davis and Nolen_Hoeksema  \n_15_ _ who ex_\namined the influence of self_reported rumination on ex_ecutive functions_ especially on executive control and cognitive flexibility_ In their study_ high ruminators made more preservative errors than nonruminators_ In line with this finding high_ruminating MDD patients of the current study reached a lower score in the executive do_main _indicating greater deficits_ than low ruminators_ The decreasing influence of rumination on the executive domain score in further calculations may be due to the fact that the range between high and low rumination in the current study is smaller than between the high and nonruminators in Davis and Nolen_Hoeksema_s  \n_15_  in_\nvestigation_\n  In contrast to previous reports from experimental \nstudies_ which showed an association between rumina_tion and attentional deficits _e_g_  \n16 _  22 __ we found no \nsignificant difference between the 2 rumination groups in our analysis_ Furthermore_ our study does not support the existence of a link between rumination and memory def_icits as well as working memory deficits found by other researchers _e_g_  \n23 _  24 __ In this context the findings of \nTeasdale et al_  _40_  and Antrobus  _41_  have to be taken \ninto consideration_ They observed that increasing the cognitive demands of the current external task led to a reduction in the frequency of off_task thoughts_ resulting in an improvement in task performance_ These results suggest that attention_demanding tasks may disrupt ru_mination_ In the current study_ we observed rumination \nin the everyday life of patients_ with no rumination induc_tion_ For this reason_ one could argue that a 1_h neuro_psychological examination already constitutes an in_creased cognitive demand_ which interrupts rumination_ In this brief period of time_ participants of our study may exhibit a relative improvement in their cognitive perfor_mance compared to their performance in everyday life_\n  Another important point should be taken into consid_\neration when interpreting the results concerning the in_fluence of rumination on memory_ Based on evidence from _choking under pressure_  \n_42_ 43_  _ it is plausible to \nassume that rumination as a predominantly verbal phe_nomenon mainly absorbs verbal capacities_ Using a vi_sual but not a verbal memory test may cause less interfer_ence with rumination and therefore mask possible rela_tionships between rumination and memory_ This fact may Iimit the interpretations to a nonsignificant relation_ship between rumination and visual memory_ although there is a nonsignificant relationship between rumination and verbal working memory_\n  To our knowledge_ the present investigation is the first \nthat has attempted to systematically determine the impact of rumination on cognitive impairments in MDD in a broad range of cognitive domains_ A differentiated stan_dardization was available for each domain_ Another im_portant difference between the current study and the ma_jority of previous studies is the absence of induced rumi_nation_ Typically_ participants are induced to ruminate or distract from rumination_ before being asked to complete cognitive tasks_ These rumination and distraction induc_tions may produce stronger differences in cognitive per_formance in the laboratory compared to selecting par_ticipants based on their RSQ_D score_ \n  However_ there are some limitations to this study that \nshould be addressed in future research_ The first limita_tion is due to the outpatient MDD sample_ Only 3 of 21 patients of the high_rumination group were male_ There_fore_ no conclusions can be drawn about the influence of gender_ Furthermore_ the variance of rumination scores in this sample was restricted_ therefore_ our results might underestimate the association between rumination and cognitive deficits_ Further research should extend the sample in addition to inpatients and healthy controls_ Secondly_ one could argue that the lack of impact of ru_mination on some cognitive domains is due to the com_puting of

attention score was the only one with _ _ 0_70_ all other computed domain scores showed a high internal consistency __ _ 0_80__ The third problem concerns the unequal distribution of partici_pants_ The group of low ruminators was almost twice as large as that of the high ruminators_ This restricted only the mean value analyses on the basis of  t  tests_ but not the \nhierarchical regression analysis_ Finally_ it is also impor_tant to note that the present study did not allow us to draw any causal conclusions about the relationship between rumination and cognitive impairments in MDD_ Due to the limitations mentioned above_ it is important to verify whether our results can be generalized_\n  The current findings offer new insights into the fre_\nquently observed link between rumination and cognitive impairments in MDD_ We have proved that patients who tend to ruminate in everyday life only show limitations in processing speed_ but not a general reduction in their cog_nitive performance_ For a limited period of time they can exhibit the cognitive performance comparable to that of low ruminators_ Inpatients and healthy controls should be included in the samples of subsequent studies to enable \ngeneralization of this study_s findings_ Another question unanswered by this study concerns the point in time at which attention starts to tilt and provide space for rumi_nation under conditions of increasing cognitive demands_ These prevailing ruminating thoughts can occupy cogni_tive resources and lead to a decreased cognitive perfor_mance_ as shown in many experimental studies_ This question is highly relevant in everyday life and highlights the necessity for further investigations_\n Acknowledgments \nWe are grateful to all participating patients and
