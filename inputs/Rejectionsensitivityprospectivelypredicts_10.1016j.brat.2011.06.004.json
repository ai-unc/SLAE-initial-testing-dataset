    "PaperContents": "Abstract\n Converging research findings indicate that rumination is correlated with a specific maladaptive interpersonal style encapsulating submissive (overly-accommodating, non-assertive and self-sacrificing) behaviours, and an attachment orientation characterised by rejection sensitivity. This study examined the prospective longitudinal relationship between rumination, the submissive interpersonal style, and rejection sensitivity by comparing two alternative hypotheses: (a) the submissive interpersonal style and rejection sensitivity prospectively predict increased rumination; (b) rumination prospectively predicts the submissive interpersonal style and rejection sensitivity. Currently depressed (n = 22), previously depressed (n = 42) and never depressed (n = 28) individuals completed self-report measures assessing depressive rumination and key psychosocial measures of interpersonal style and behaviours, at baseline and again six months later. Baseline rejection sensitivity prospectively predicted increased rumination six months later, after statistically controlling for baseline rumination, gender and depression. Baseline rumination did not predict the submissive interpersonal style or rejection sensitivity. The results provide a first step towards delineating a potential casual relationship between rejection sensitivity and rumination, and suggest the potential value of clinical assessment and intervention for both rejection sensitivity and rumination in individuals who present with either difficulty.\n \n Highlights\n \u25ba Investigation of prospective relationship between rumination, submissive interpersonal style and rejection sensitivity. \u25ba Rejection sensitivity prospectively predicts increased rumination. \u25ba Rumination a non-significant predictor of rejection sensitivity or submissive interpersonal style.\n \n Previous article in issueNext article in issue\n Keywords\n RuminationDepressionInterpersonal styleSubmissiveRejection sensitivity\n Introduction\n Depressive rumination has been defined as repetitively focussing on the symptoms of distress and their causes and meanings (Nolen-Hoeksema, Wisco, & Lyubomirsky, 2008). Findings from a range of experimental and longitudinal studies have implicated depressive rumination in the onset and maintenance of depression (for reviews see Nolen-Hoeksema et al., 2008, Watkins, 2008). Recent analyses of rumination have distinguished between distinct factors: a maladaptive factor labelled brooding, defined as \u2018a passive comparison of one\u2019s current situation with some unachieved standard\u2019 (Treynor, Gonzalez, & Nolen-Hoeksema, 2003, p. 256), which prospectively predicted increase in depressive symptoms, and a more adaptive reflection factor, defined as actively attempting to gain insight into problems, which did not predict prospective depression.\n \n Nolen-Hoeksema, 1991, Nolen-Hoeksema, 2004 response styles theory (RST) defines rumination as being a stable vulnerability factor for depression, i.e., RST assumes that rumination remains elevated in people who have a vulnerability to depression even when they are not currently depressed. Consistent with this conceptualisation of rumination as a trait characteristic, findings from several empirical studies indicate that rumination is elevated in those who have a history of depression compared to those who have never been depressed (Bagby et al., 2004, Nolen-Hoeksema, 2000, Roberts et al., 1998).\n \n Similarly, a maladaptive interpersonal style characterised by excessive reliance on closeness to others (i.e. dependency) has been conceptualised as a depressogenic vulnerability factor in cognitive (Beck, 1983), attachment (Bifulco, Moran, Ball, & Bernazzani, 2002), and psychodynamic (Blatt, Quinlan, Chevron, McDonald, & Zuroff, 1982) formulations of depression. Consistent with the conceptualisation of this maladaptive interpersonal style as a trait characteristic, empirical findings from a number of studies indicate that dependency is elevated in both currently depressed and formerly depressed individuals compared to those who have never been depressed (Franche and Dobson, 1992, Klein et al., 1988). In addition, findings from longitudinal studies indicate that cognitive-affective processing systems and behavioural strategies characteristic of dependent individuals confer vulnerability to future depression; Thus, women who tend to anxiously expect and fear interpersonal rejection (labelled \u201crejection sensitivity\u201d, Downey & Feldman, 1996) are more likely to experience depression following a relationship break-up (Ayduk, Downey, & Kim, 2001). Moreover, the tendency to seek reassurance from close others that one is loved (labelled \u201cexcessive reassurance seeking\u201d, Davila, 2001) and submissiveness to others (Ball, Otto, Pollack, & Rosenbaum, 1994) are related behavioural factors which prospectively predict future depression.\n \n Given that both cognitive mechanisms, such as rumination, and interpersonal behaviours are implicated in the aetiology of depression, it is theoretically plausible that they may be associated, leading to proposed integrations of cognitive and interpersonal models of depression (Joiner, 2000, Schmidt et al., 1999). Indeed, Joiner (2000, p. 211) proposed that depressive rumination might be the \u201ccognitive motor\u201d which fuels depressive interpersonal mechanisms. Consistent with this hypothesis, rumination was significantly correlated with a range of maladaptive interpersonal behaviours in depressed patients (Lam, Schuck, Smith, Farmer, & Checkley, 2003) and positively associated with diminished relationship satisfaction in remitted depressed patients (Kuehner & Buerger, 2005).\n \n More specifically, converging evidence suggests the hypothesis that depressive rumination is associated with a subset of interpersonal behaviours and concerns characterised by excessive relationship concerns (Gorski and Young, 2002, Nolen-Hoeksema and Jackson, 2001, Spasojevi\u0107 and Alloy, 2001) and fear of rejection (Saffrey & Ehrenberg, 2007), passivity and avoidance (Lyubomirsky and Nolen-Hoeksema, 1993, Moulds et al., 2007) and submissiveness (Cheung, Gilbert, & Irons, 2004). Consistent with this hypothesis, a recent cross-sectional study found that depressive rumination was specifically associated with a submissive interpersonal style (incorporating overly-accommodating, non-assertive, and self-sacrificing behaviours), and rejection sensitivity, even after controlling for depressive symptoms, gender, and other interpersonal styles (Pearson, Watkins, Mullan, & Moberly, 2010).\n \n These cross-sectional findings raise questions about the temporal and causal nature of relationship between depressive rumination and this maladaptive submissive interpersonal style. Some research suggests a potential role of rejection sensitivity in exacerbating rumination. First, Nolen-Hoeksema and Jackson (2001) proposed and found that people who are excessively concerned with maintaining close relationships are susceptible to rumination in order to monitor how their relationships are going. Second, Saffrey and Ehrenberg (2007) proposed that individuals who are preoccupied by fears of rejection and abandonment have more difficulty adjusting following the end of a relationship, thereby leading to increased rumination about the interpersonal loss. Consistent with this hypothesis, they found that, following an interpersonal rejection, rumination was elevated in individuals with heightened fears of rejection and abandonment. Third, relative to those low in rejection sensitivity, high rejection-sensitive individuals report greater feelings of rejection following the presentation of experimentally-manipulated ambiguous feedback (Downey & Feldman, 1996), show greater depression following a relationship break-up (Ayduk et al., 2001), and show biases towards greater self-referential encoding and recall of rejection relevant material (Mor & Inbar, 2009). Since perceived rejection reflects an important unresolved goal of high personal relevance (i.e., to avoid rejection and to be in a secure relationship), and rumination is hypothesised to be activated in response to unresolved goals (Martin and Tesser, 1996, Watkins, 2008), rejection sensitivity may therefore increase vulnerability to rumination. Furthermore, increased recall and activation of negative material would lead to increased accessibility of negative memories of rejection, which may feed into repetitive and ruminative thought. Consistent with this possibility, rejection-sensitive people described ruminating in response to an ambiguous situation more than people low in rejection sensitivity (Downey & Feldman, 1996).\n \n Similar accounts suggest the hypothesis that submissive, overly-accommodating, non-assertive and self-sacrificing behaviours might contribute to increased rumination. First, being unassertive may lead to poorer interpersonal problem solving (Chiauzzi & Heimberg, 1986) and decreased social competence (Paulsen, Bru, & Murberg, 2006), and hence to the maintenance of unresolved interpersonal goals, driving further rumination. Moreover, if important personal concerns are silenced to accommodate others\u2019 needs but remain unresolved, it is likely that they will become the subject of further internal ruminations (O\u2019Mahen, Flynn, & Nolen-Hoeksema, 2010). Second, rumination is itself a manifestation of a passive response style (Nolen-Hoeksema, 1991, Nolen-Hoeksema, 2004) and, therefore, may become more frequent as a more passive style of responding is adopted, particularly in situations where people perceive they have little control over their environment. For example, Nolen-Hoeksema, Larson, and Grayson (1999, p. 1062) argued that women ruminate more because \u201cthey are searching for ways in which they can control their environment and their distress but do not feel efficacious about exerting that control and thus remain stuck in rumination.\u201d.\n \n In contrast, Tse and Bond (2004) hypothesised that rumination fuels social functioning difficulties in depression by occupying cognitive resources necessary for social perception and interpersonal problem solving, and by activating negative cognitive schemata, negatively biasing how people interpret and respond to social stimuli. Consistent with this argument, experimental findings have indicated that rumination is causally implicated in increased negative thinking and impaired interpersonal problem solving (Lyubomirsky and Nolen-Hoeksema, 1995, Lyubomirsky et al., 1999), and reduced motivation and initiative (Lyubomirsky & Nolen-Hoeksema, 1993). These negative cognitive and motivational consequences of rumination would be expected to generate passive and unassertive interpersonal behaviours, as well as contribute to increased perceptions of rejection. Consistent with this hypothesis, Nolen-Hoeksema (2004, p. 112) argued that a greater tendency to ruminate can function to keep women \u201cstuck in cycles of passivity and impair their ability to overcome other problems contributing to their depression such as inequities in their marriages\u201d.\n \n Many of the studies reviewed are limited in using a cross-sectional design, leaving unresolved the temporal nature of relationship between rumination and interpersonal style, that is, whether these interpersonal responses are antecedents and/or consequences of depressive rumination (e.g., Nolen-Hoeksema and Jackson, 2001, Saffrey and Ehrenberg, 2007). Moreover, some of the studies utilised non-clinical samples (e.g., Saffrey and Ehrenberg, 2007, Spasojevi\u0107 and Alloy, 2001), making it unclear to what extent the findings can be generalised to an underlying clinical population.\n \n Therefore the principal aim of this study was to investigate the temporal nature of the relationship between depressive rumination and elements of the associated maladaptive interpersonal style. In order to optimise variability in rumination in the current study sample it was deemed necessary to recruit currently depressed, previously depressed and never depressed individuals. By examining the prospective relationship between rumination and interpersonal style in a mixed sample, we tested two contrasting (but not mutually exclusive) hypotheses: (a) the submissive interpersonal style and elevated rejection sensitivity will predict increased rumination (brooding) six months later, controlling for baseline rumination, gender and depression; (b) rumination (brooding) will predict increased submissiveness and rejection sensitivity six months later, controlling for the baseline interpersonal measures, gender and depression. Given previous findings indicating that brooding is the maladaptive subcomponent of rumination, we predicted that any prospective relationship between rumination, the maladaptive submissive interpersonal style and rejection sensitivity would be evident for brooding but not for reflection.\n \n Method\n Participants\n At baseline (Time 1), participants (N = 103) were recruited from a primary care service for depression (n = 25) and from the wider community (n = 78). (For further details, see Pearson et al. (2010), which reported on the cross-sectional analysis at baseline of this sample.) Participants were recruited from the wider community, via a poster campaign which invited currently depressed (n = 29), previously depressed (n = 42), and never depressed (n = 32), individuals to take part in the study. The aim of this recruitment strategy was to maximise the variance of depressive symptoms, rumination, and social functioning impairment in the sample, and, thereby, enhance our ability to detect relationships between variables.\n \n The analyses reported in this paper were drawn from the sample of individuals who completed Time 1 and Time 2 measures (n = 92, Table 1). Nine of those who were currently depressed at Time 1 (n = 22) remained depressed at Time 2. Seven of those who reported a past history of depression at Time 1 (n = 42) experienced an interim episode of depression between Time 1 and Time 2. There were no new onset depressive episodes reported in the never depressed group. There were no significant differences between those who did not complete the follow-up interview and those who did in relation to age, gender, Time 1 depressive symptoms, Time 1 brooding or Time 1 interpersonal difficulties. Exclusion criteria included a history of bipolar disorder (n = 2 excluded), psychotic symptoms (n = 1 excluded), being unable to engage for physical or practical reasons and current suicidal ideation (no participants were excluded on the basis of these final two criteria).\n \n Table 1.

The SCID Mood Disorders module was used to assess current depression status (i.e., to ascertain whether the individual met the DSM-IV criteria for a current major depressive episode at the baseline assessment), past history of depression (whether the individual had previously experienced one or more episodes of depression consistent with the DSM-IV criteria for a past major depressive episode) and current dysthymia. Participants were also screened for bipolar disorder and psychosis. There was an excellent level of inter-rater reliability for diagnoses of current depression (\u03ba = 1) and past major depression (\u03ba = 1) between the original interviewer and an independent rater blind to condition, based on 10 randomly selected participants.\n \n Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI; Beck, Steer, & Brown, 1996)\n The BDI is a well-validated 21-item self-report questionnaire, which measures depressive symptom severity in the past two weeks. Participants rate their answers using a 4-point scale with higher scores indicating greater depression severity (range 0\u201363). In this study, the BDI-II demonstrated high internal consistency (\u03b1 = .96).\n \n Response Style Questionnaire (RSQ) \u2013 Ruminative Responses Scale (RRS; Nolen-Hoeksema, 1991; Treynor et al., 2003)\n The RSQ is a self-report measure which includes a 22-item Ruminative Response Scale (RRS), assessing the tendency to ruminate in response to depressed mood. Participants are asked to rate how often (almost never, sometimes, often, almost always) they think and do different things when feeling down, sad or depressed, e.g., \u201cThink \u2018why can\u2019t I get going?\u2019\u201d. In this study the RRS had a high level of internal consistency (Time 1 \u03b1 = .96, Time 2 \u03b1 = .96). Brooding was measured using five items from the RRS scale, e.g., \u201cThink \u2018why do I always react this way?\u2019\u201d (Time 1 \u03b1 = .85, Time 2 \u03b1 = .86). Reflection was measured using another five items from the RRS measure, e.g., \u201cAnalyse recent events to try and understand why you are depressed\u201d (Time 1 \u03b1 = .86, Time 2 \u03b1 = .81).\n \n The Inventory of Interpersonal Problems-64 (IIP-64; Alden, Wiggins, & Pincus, 1990)\n The IIP-64 is a self-report questionnaire measuring interpersonal difficulties, with eight sub-scales derived from dimensions of affiliation (hostile/cold to friendly behaviour) and dominance (submissive to controlling behaviour). Three of the eight IIP sub-scales were included in this study because previous research (Pearson et al., 2010) found these behaviours to be specifically and concurrently associated with rumination at baseline: Self-Sacrificing (e.g., \u201cI put other people\u2019s needs before my own too much\u201d); Overly-accommodating (e.g., \u201cI let other people take advantage of me too much\u201d); Non-assertive (e.g., \u201cI find it difficult to let other people know what I want\u201d). These sub-scales demonstrated good internal consistency: Self-sacrificing (Time 1 \u03b1 = .84, Time 2 \u03b1 = .89); Overly-accommodating (Time 1 \u03b1 = .82, Time 2 \u03b1 = .86); Non-assertive (Time 1 \u03b1 = .88, Time 2 \u03b1 = .90).\n \n Depressive Interpersonal Relationships Inventory \u2013 Reassurance Seeking Scale (DIRI-ERS; Joiner & Metalsky, 2001)\n The DIRI-ERS is a 4-item sub-scale of the DIRI which measures frequency of engaging in excessive reassurance-seeking behaviours (e.g., \u201cIn general, do you find yourself often asking the people you feel close to how they truly feel about you?\u201d) on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (no, not at all) to 7 (yes, very much). The scale had good internal consistency (\u03b1 = .88).\n \n Adult Rejection Sensitivity Questionnaire (ARSQ; Downey, Berenson, & Kang, 2006)\n The ARSQ consists of nine hypothetical situations involving interactions with partner, family, friends, and strangers, with the potential for rejection (e.g., \u201cLately, you\u2019ve been noticing some distance between yourself and your significant other, and you ask him/her if there is something wrong\u201d). Individuals rate the degree to which they are concerned about rejection and degree of anticipatory anxiety about rejection on two 6-point scales, with a composite rejection-sensitivity score calculated by multiplying these ratings. The total rejection-sensitivity score is the mean of these composite scores. The scale demonstrated good internal consistency (T1 \u03b1 = .86, T2 \u03b1 = .86). The ARSQ was included in this study because Pearson et al. (2010) found that rejection sensitivity was the attachment orientation most strongly associated concurrently with rumination (p = .05) at initial assessment.\n \n Interpersonal components\n In a previous analysis of the baseline data for this study (Pearson et al., 2010) a Principal Components Analysis was calculated to address issues of multi-collinearity between the interpersonal behaviour variables (IIP-64 sub-scales and the DIRI-ERS sub-scale), and to reduce the number of variables which were included in the hierarchical regression analysis. This resulted in the extraction of three interpersonal components (accounting for 80.71% of the variance): Component 1, \u201csubmissive interpersonal style\u201d had three items with salient loadings (>.5): the IIP sub-scales concerned with overly-accommodating, non-assertive, and self-sacrificing behaviours. This component encapsulated an interpersonal style characterised by excessive submissiveness and low assertiveness. Component 2, labelled \u201cneedy interpersonal style\u201d had three items with salient loadings (>.5): the IIP intrusive-needy and domineering sub-scales and excessive reassurance seeking. This component encapsulated an interpersonal style characterised by excessive friendly dominance and reliance on close others. Component 3 labelled \u201ccold interpersonal style\u201d (eigenvalue = 3.38 after rotation) had three items with salient loadings (>.5): IIP cold, vindictive and socially inhibited sub-scales. This component encapsulated an interpersonal style characterised by difficulties forming and maintaining intimate relationships with other people.\n \n Findings from preliminary cross-sectional analyses (Pearson et al., 2010) indicated that the submissive interpersonal style was specifically associated with brooding after controlling for depressive symptoms. Because the needy and cold interpersonal styles were not associated concurrently with brooding they were excluded from the prospective analyses in the current study.\n \n Component scores for the baseline data were computed in SPSS using the regression method. The Time 2 component scores for the submissive interpersonal style were computed by first transforming each of the IIP scores to a z score and then multiplying the z score by the component score coefficient (Field, 2005).\n \n Procedure\n Participants were interviewed by the researcher to assess baseline (Time 1) diagnostic status and then completed the battery of self-report questionnaires. Six months later (Time 2), participants were interviewed again to reassess diagnostic status and completed another set of the self-report measures.\n \n Results\n Data analysis\n The first set of hierarchical regression analyses assessed the contribution of baseline submissive interpersonal style and rejection sensitivity as predictors of rumination, brooding, and reflection six months later. The second set of analyses assessed the contribution of baseline rumination, brooding, and reflection as predictors of Time 2 submissive interpersonal style and rejection sensitivity. SPSS diagnostics were examined to ensure that the hierarchical regression models were not biased due to multi-collinearity (all VIF < 4, all tolerance statistics > .2) and to check that the assumption of normality of residuals was met (there were no outlier standardised residual scores > 3, and an examination of histograms of the standardised residuals indicated a normal distribution).\n \n Preliminary analyses\n Table 2 presents the correlations between the key variables. Time 1 submissive interpersonal style, Time 1 rejection sensitivity, and Time 1 depressive symptoms were all significantly positively correlated with Time 2 rumination (brooding and reflection). Rumination at baseline was significantly positively correlated with the Time 2 measures of submissive interpersonal style and rejection sensitivity. Gender was not correlated with the key study measures at Time 2.\n \n Table 2.

Neither gender nor Time 1 depressive symptoms predicted Time 2 brooding (gender, \u03b2 = \u2212.13, t(75) = \u2212.17, p = .86, depressive symptoms, \u03b2 = .05, t(75) = 1.38, p = .17). Together, these control variables explained 32% of the variance in Time 2 brooding and the model was statistically significant, F(3, 75) = 11.87, p < .001. Adding the interpersonal variables at step 2 significantly improved the model, \u2206R2 = .07, p < .05 and the model was statistically significant, F(5, 73) = 9.36, p < .001. Time 1 rejection sensitivity was a significant predictor of Time 2 brooding, \u03b2 = .26, t(73) = 2.84, p < .01, although the submissive interpersonal style was not a significant predictor of brooding, \u03b2 = .39, t(73) = .83, p = .41.\n \n When an equivalent hierarchical regression analysis was calculated with the Reflection sub-scale as the criterion variable, the pattern of results for step 1 was the same as for the previous model in which brooding was the criterion variable. Adding the interpersonal variables at step 2 did not significantly improve the model, \u2206R2 = .04, p = .14, although the overall model was statistically significant, F(5, 73) = 7.70, p < .001. In addition, Time 1 rejection sensitivity was a marginally significant predictor of Time 2 reflection, \u03b2 = .18, t(73) = 1.97, p \u2264 .05. The submissive interpersonal style was a non-significant predictor of Time 2 reflection, \u03b2 = .27, t(73) = .60, p = .55.2\n \n Brooding and reflection predict the submissive interpersonal style and rejection sensitivity\n To test our second hypothesis that brooding will prospectively predict increased submissiveness and rejection sensitivity after controlling for baseline interpersonal style, gender and depression, we conducted one hierarchical regression model in which the Time 2 submissive interpersonal style was the criterion variable (Table 5), and another hierarchical regression model in which Time 2 rejection sensitivity was the criterion variable (Table 6). In each model, the Time 1 measure of interpersonal style (Time 1 submissive interpersonal style or Time 1 rejection sensitivity), gender and Time 1 depressive symptoms were entered at step 1 as control variables. Brooding and reflection were entered simultaneously at step 2.\n \n Table 5.

We tested two contrasting but not mutually exclusive hypotheses: (a) an interpersonal style characterised by submissiveness and rejection sensitivity is an antecedent and potential cause of rumination (e.g., Nolen-Hoeksema and Jackson, 2001, Nolen-Hoeksema et al., 1999, Saffrey and Ehrenberg, 2007); (b) rumination is an antecedent and potential cause of the submissive interpersonal style and rejection sensitivity (e.g., Lyubomirsky et al., 1999, Nolen-Hoeksema, 2004, Tse and Bond, 2004).\n \n Partially consistent with the first hypothesis, we found that rejection sensitivity prospectively predicted rumination (brooding, p < .01, and reflection, p \u2264 .05) six months later, after controlling for baseline rumination, depression, and gender. Although the regression coefficient for the relationship between Time 1 rejection sensitivity and Time 2 brooding was larger than that found for the relationship between Time 1 rejection sensitivity and Time 2 reflection, the difference between two regression coefficients was not significantly different (d = .08, p = .70). This pattern of findings was therefore inconsistent with the hypothesis that rejection sensitivity would be a stronger predictor of brooding. Contrary to the first hypothesis, the submissive interpersonal style did not predict rumination (brooding or reflection).\n \n Inconsistent with the second hypothesis, rumination (brooding and reflection) did not significantly predict increased submissiveness or rejection sensitivity six months later, after controlling for baseline interpersonal style, depression, and gender. Thus, it appears that rejection sensitivity is a temporal antecedent of rumination, but that the submissive interpersonal style is not temporally antecedent to increased rumination. We note that the lack of a prospective relationship between Time 1 rumination and Time 2 submissiveness could also reflect the high degree of stability in the submissive interpersonal style over time (r = .87).\n \n The findings are consistent with the hypothesis that rejection sensitivity causes rumination, but are inconsistent with the hypothesis that rumination causes rejection sensitivity. Thus, the results provide a necessary, but not sufficient, first step towards clarifying the causal nature of relationship between rejection sensitivity and rumination. If the hypothesis that rejection sensitivity plays a causal role in rumination is correct, then as a minimum, one would expect to see that rejection sensitivity predicts subsequent rumination as found here: Failure to find this relationship would have disconfirmed the hypothesis that rejection sensitivity causally contributes to rumination. However, the predictive relationship could still be accounted for by a third factor that predicts both rejection sensitivity and rumination. For example, childhood abuse is associated with both rumination (Nolen-Hoeksema, 2004) and rejection sensitivity (Feldman & Downey, 1994), and could potentially predict both variables. Moreover, because rejection sensitivity is associated with diminished relationship quality (Downey & Feldman, 1996) and because ruminators rely on social support to disrupt ruminative thinking and to \u201cpush them to take action on the concrete problems they are facing\u201d (Nolen-Hoeksema & Davis, 1999, p. 812), another possibility is that rejection sensitivity contributes indirectly to rumination by eroding relationship quality, diminishing social support and increasing social isolation. Therefore, to determine if rejection sensitivity does causally influence rumination, rejection sensitivity needs to be manipulated and shown to then directly influence levels of rumination, either in experimental studies or via clinical interventions. One limitation of the current study is that a number of these potential third factors such as childhood abuse and social isolation were not assessed (reflecting a practical limitation on what variables could be assessed) leaving unresolved their potential contribution to these relationships. Therefore, future studies investigating the relationship between rumination and rejection sensitivity should also include indices of relationship quality and/or social support, and early experience.\n \n These findings are also consistent with a control theory (Carver and Scheier, 1990, Carver and Scheier, 1998) account of rumination (Martin and Tesser, 1996, Watkins, 2008). In goal-discrepancy terms, rejection sensitivity renders the goals of maintaining relationships and avoiding abandonment especially salient and intrinsically linked to self definition (Ayduk & Gyurak, 2008), whilst at the same time increasing the likelihood of perceiving rejection (Downey and Feldman, 1996, Mor and Inbar, 2009). Thus individuals who are highly sensitive to rejection are more likely to perceive that the valued goals of avoiding rejection and maintaining relationships are not being met, generating the unresolved goal discrepancies that drive rumination (Martin & Tesser, 1996). Moreover, according to the control theory model, it will be particularly difficult for individuals to disengage from the goal of preventing rejection because this is an avoidance goal which cannot be satisfactorily resolved (Carver & Scheier, 1998), thus making it more likely that rejection sensitivity will generate ongoing cycles of ruminative thinking (i.e., unresolved goal related thoughts) than attainment related goals which have a more clearly demarcated end point.\n \n We note that when the submissive interpersonal style and rejection sensitivity were entered into the regression equation, only rejection sensitivity predicted future rumination, whereas the submissive interpersonal style did not. One potential account for why rejection sensitivity emerges as the only significant predictor of rumination might be because it predicts submissive interpersonal behaviours and already accounts for much of the variance in the relationship between the other interpersonal behaviours and rumination. In order to investigate this possibility, a supplementary analysis was undertaken which investigated whether Time 1 rejection sensitivity predicted Time 2 submissiveness. Results from a supplementary analysis which tested this hypothesis with the current study dataset were inconsistent with this proposed explanation.5 Another possibility is that whilst both rejection sensitivity and submissive interpersonal behaviours prevent effective resolution of goal discrepancies, thereby driving further rumination, only rejection sensitivity involves a heightened vigilance for important goals not being met, which could initiate new cycles of rumination.\n \n It is noteworthy that female gender did not predict increased rumination in the current study when RST evolved as a theory to explain gender differences in depression. The finding that depression is more common in women than men, and that rumination is a factor which mediates this gender difference in depression, has been replicated in a number of studies (Butler and Nolen-Hoeksema, 1994, Grant et al., 2004, Nolen-Hoeksema and Jackson, 2001, Nolen-Hoeksema et al., 1999, Nolen-Hoeksema et al., 1993, Roberts et al., 1998). This discrepancy could reflect differences between the current study sample and samples used in previous studies. The majority of studies which have tested whether gender mediates the effect of rumination on depression have used large community or undergraduate samples where the rates of depression are relatively low (Butler and Nolen-Hoeksema, 1994, Grant et al., 2004, Nolen-Hoeksema and Jackson, 2001, Nolen-Hoeksema et al., 1993, Nolen-Hoeksema et al., 1999). Thus, the current study results suggest that the gender difference in rumination might be less evident in selected depressed and depression vulnerable individuals. Consistent with this hypothesis, in a clinical sample of patients with major depression, Watkins (2009) failed to replicate the repeated finding within undergraduate and community samples that rumination is elevated in women relative to men. This result suggests that this pattern does not generalise to a sample of patients with recurrent histories of depression seeking specialist psychological help. It may be that in those individuals who have experienced frequent depression, rates of rumination are elevated regardless of gender, either because elevated rumination is a predisposition that confers vulnerability to subsequent depression or because repeated experience of depression exacerbates rumination.\n \n Some limitations of the study should be noted. First, as noted earlier, because the study design included only two time points and there was no manipulation of the key variables, inferences about the causal relationship between rumination, brooding, and the interpersonal style are limited. Nonetheless, to our knowledge, this is the first study to test the prospective relationship between depressive rumination, rejection sensitivity, and the submissive interpersonal style, thereby, providing a first step in examining the causal direction of the relationship between rumination, attachment orientation and interpersonal style. Second, the current study used a relatively small sample size, potentially limiting statistical power to detect relationships between variables. Another limitation is the reliance on self-report measurement of rumination and interpersonal behaviours, introducing the potential for measurement inaccuracy and/or biased responses. Nonetheless, these findings suggest that rejection sensitivity is a specific temporal antecedent of depressive rumination. Key strengths of the study were its prospective design, statistically controlling for baseline rumination, depression, and gender in predicting future rumination, and inclusion of a heterogeneous mix of currently depressed, previously depressed, and never depressed individuals, to maximise the range of depression and rumination scores, and to increase the generalisability of the findings.\n \n The study findings have implications for theory of rumination and its aetiology. First, the results highlight that, although rumination is an intrapersonal process, it is also highly focused on, and potentially fuelled by, underlying interpersonal concerns characterised by fear and anticipation of rejection. Second, the results suggest that early childhood experiences of rejection or abandonment might be causally implicated in the development of a ruminative response style. Further investigation is required to delineate what determines whether rejection-sensitive individuals are susceptible to engaging in harmful brooding or, less harmful, reflection. One possibility is that effect of diagnostic status interacts with rejection sensitivity to influence the type of rumination that occurs (i.e. a rejection-sensitive individual who is not depressed may be more likely to engage in reflection than brooding). However, results from the current study were inconsistent with this hypothesis, because depression status did not moderate the effect of rejection sensitivity on brooding or reflection.\n \n The finding that rejection sensitivity prospectively predicts increased rumination has implications for clinical assessment and treatment. First, this finding suggests that when a clinician identifies that an individual is highly sensitive to rejection, he/she should be alert to the possibility that this individual might also be engaging in ruminative thinking, as a maladaptive regulatory mechanism for maintaining relationships and avoiding rejection. Second, the findings raise the interesting possibility that interventions for depression which specifically target interpersonal difficulties (e.g. interpersonal psychotherapy, Weissman, Markowitz, & Klerman, 2000), and those which seek to modify maladaptive relational schemas and intermediate beliefs associated with fear and expectation of rejection (e.g. schema change in cognitive therapy, Padesky, 1994) might also reduce the likelihood that people will go on to engage in harmful cycles of rumination.\n \n In conclusion, the results suggest that rejection sensitivity is a specific prospective predictor for increased depressive rumination and brooding, whilst indicating that rumination does not prospectively predict rejection sensitivity or passive interpersonal behaviours. Future research will need to more fully delineate the causal direction of the relationship between rumination and rejection sensitivity, with the aim of informing the development of integrative cognitive and interpersonal interventions for those susceptible to either difficulty.
