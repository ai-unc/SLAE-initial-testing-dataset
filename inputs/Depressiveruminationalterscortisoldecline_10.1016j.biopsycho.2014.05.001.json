Results thereby provide important insights into the interaction of biological and psychological factors through which distress contributes to MDD_\n\n1_ Introduction\nA central feature of Major Depressive Disorder _MDD_ is the tendency to respond to sadness with rumination_ a maladaptive emotion regulation strategy that has been shown to predict the duration and severity of depressive episodes _McLaughlin and Nolen_Hoeksema_ 2011_ Nolen_Hoeksema et al__ 2008__ The response styles theory _Nolen_Hoeksema et al__ 2008_ defines depressive rumination as a method of processing negative events by repetitively focusing on feelings of distress as well as the potential antecedents or repercussions of these feelings_ A substantial body of research has demonstrated negative behavioral and emotional consequences of depressive rumination_ Compared to more adaptive emotion regulation strategies_ such as distraction_ ruminative responses to sad mood diminish problem solving_ increase engagement in maladaptive behaviors_ and hinder recovery from negative events _Lyubomirsky and Tkach_ 2004_ Nolen_Hoeksema et al__ 2008__ Most notably_ experimental research has shown that when individuals are in a sad mood state_ rumination leads to more self_reported sadness compared to distraction _Feldner_ Leen_Feldner_ Zvolensky_ _ Lejuez_ 2006__ Depressive rumination_ therefore_ is believed to directly contribute to the pervasive low mood associated with depressive episodes _Morrow _ Nolen_Hoeksema_ 1990__ In contrast to the considerable research examining the emotional and behavioral effects of depressive rumination_ relatively little is understood about the consequences of depressive rumination on physical health_ and in particular_ on neuroendocrine functioning_\n\nRecent theories posit that the maladaptive consequences of some forms of repetitive thought_ including stressor_focused and depressive rumination_ extend beyond emotional wellbeing to physical wellbeing _Brosschot_ Gerin_ _ Thayer_ 2006_ see review by Watkins_ 2008__ Specifically_ the continual processing or contemplation of a depressing or stressful event is predicted to alter individuals_ biological functioning_ The neuroendocrine system plays a primary role in our body_s biological functioning _Patchev _ Patchev_ 2006__ A central component of the neuroendocrine system is the hypothalamic_pituitary_adrenal _HPA_ axis_ a primary index of which is the hormone cortisol_ Whereas moderate cortisol fluctuation facilitates adaptive responses to environmental changes_ excess cortisol production _ often stemming from chronic HPA axis activity _ can be detrimental _Dedovic et al__ 2009_ Gold et al__ 2002_ Sephton and Speigel_ 2003__ Prolonged cortisol secretion leads to neurotoxicity in areas of the brain responsible for regulating emotions and coping effectively with distress _McEwen_ 2006__ Excessive cortisol secretion also has been shown to increase risk for medical conditions_ including cancer_ diabetes_ and arthritis _McEwen_ 1998__ making it critical to understand factors associated with greater cortisol secretion_\n\nInitial work in nonclinical populations has provided evidence for a connection between stressor_focused rumination and cortisol elevations _see review by Zoccola _ Dickerson_ 2012__ Extending these findings to a sample of depressed adolescence_ Stewart_ Mazurka_ Bond_ Wynne_Edwards_ _2013_ found that trait depressive rumination was associated with elevated cortisol levels during the recovery period_ whereas the tendency to use more adaptive emotion regulation strategies _e_g__ distraction_problem solving_ was associated with faster cortisol decline_ The one study to use an experimental manipulation exposed participants to a sad mood induction and then randomly assigned them to a depressive rumination or distraction condition _Kuehner_ Huffziger_ _ Liebsch_ 2009__ Results showed less cortisol decline in the rumination condition among students with high versus low depression symptoms_ The effect of experimentally induced depressive rumination on cortisol levels_ however_ has never been examined within a clinically depressed sample_\n\nThe current study aimed to extend past research by examining the effects of induced depressive rumination versus distraction on cortisol secretion in clinically depressed and healthy control participants_ Participants were exposed to a forced_failure paradigm_ which was designed to place them in a sad mood state prior to the emotion regulation induction _Hammen_ 2005__ Participants then were randomly assigned to the depressive rumination or distraction condition_ Salivary cortisol was measured when participants entered the lab_ and during forced failure_ emotion regulation_ and post_emotion regulation periods_ Overall_ we expected cortisol levels to decline across the experiment as participants habituated to the stress of coming into the laboratory _Marceau_ Dorn_ _ Susman_ 2012__ However_ we expected depressive rumination to interrupt this cortisol decline_ Specifically_ we predicted that both depressed and healthy control participants in the depressive rumination condition would demonstrate less cortisol decline compared to individuals in the distraction condition_ In addition_ we expected that the effects of depressive rumination would be stronger in the group with clinical depression_\n\n2_ Methods and materials\n2_1_ Participants\nAdults 18_60 years of age were recruited via newspaper advertisements and Internet postings_ Inclusion and exclusion criteria were determined via an in_person Structured Clinical Interview for DSM_IV _SCID_ First_ Spitzer_ Gibbon_ _ Williams_ 1996__ Three clinical psychology graduate students and one post_doctoral fellow completed the SCIDs_ All interviewers completed more than 20 h of training in videotapes_ live observation_ written tests_ and group supervision in addition to the formal coursework required by the doctoral program_ Inter_rater disagreements or queries were discussed via a biweekly SCID meeting_ Inter_rater reliability was excellent_ _ _ 1_00_ Two groups were included_ those who met criteria for current MDD and those who did not meet criteria for any past or current Axis I disorder _Control_ CTL__ Participants were excluded due to severe head trauma_ learning disabilities_ bipolar disorder_ psychotic symptoms_ alcohol or substance abuse within the past 6 months_ or health conditions known to interfere with HPA axis activity _including pregnancy and endocrine disorders_ per Kudielka_ Hellhammer_ _ Wust_ 2009__ After excluding one extreme outlier _CTL__ whose initial cortisol value was more than 10 SDs greater than the mean_ there were 46 participants in the MDD group and 51 in the CTL group_\n\nAt the time of testing_ 16 MDD participants were on medication_s__ including psychotropic medication _15_ and oral contraceptives _1__ Percent of depressed participants who were on medication did not differ across emotion regulation condition_ _2_1_ N _ 46_ _ 1_53_ p _ _22_ In addition_ 5 CTL participants were on medication_s_ at the time of testing_ including oral contraceptives _4_ and blood pressure medication _1__ Percent of control participants who were on medication did not differ across emotion regulation condition_ _2_1_ N _ 51_ _ 0_18_ p _ _67_ Within the MDD group_ 35 participants met criteria for a comorbid anxiety disorder_ Percent with comorbidity did not differ across emotion regulation condition_ _2_1_ N _ 46_ _ 1_80_ p _ _18_\n\n2_2_ Forced_failure paradigm\nThree forced_failure tasks were used to induce mild sadness_ The first was a 15_min facial identification task with false feedback indicating that the participant performed poorly _Tran_ Siemer_ _ Joormann_ 2011__ Participants were asked to identify the emotional expression _happy_ sad_ angry_ depicted in subliminally presented facial expressions_ Participants repeatedly received feedback that they were performing poorly relative to others who had already completed the task_ and the experimenter urged participants to try harder_ The second task was a 5_min anagram task_ in which approximately 30_ of the anagrams were unsolvable _van Randenborgh_ H_ffmeier_ LeMoult_ _ Joormann_ 2010__ Participants were given 5 min to solve as many anagrams as possible but were allowed only 30 s to solve each anagram_ The third was a serial subtraction task _Kirschbaum_ Pirke_ _ Hellhammer_ 1993__ Participants were given 5 min to count backward aloud from 2_083 to zero in 13_step sequences as quickly and accurately as possible_ If an error was made_ the experimenter would say _error_ start again at 2_083__ No participant reached zero in the time allotted_\n\n2_3_ Emotion regulation _ER_ induction\nParticipants were randomly assigned to either a depressive rumination or distraction condition_ adapted from the frequently used emotion regulation _ER_ induction procedure developed by Nolen_Hoeksema and Morrow _1993__ This ER manipulation was selected given its use in prior studies on depressive rumination _see review by Lyubomirsky _ Tkach_ 2004__ its use when examining the relation between depressive rumination and cortisol in a student sample _Kuehner et al__ 2009__ and its consistency with Nolen_Hoeksema and colleague_s definition of depressive rumination _Nolen_Hoeksema_ 1991_ Nolen_Hoeksema et al__ 2008__ Regardless of condition_ participants viewed seven prompts one_at_a_time on the computer screen_ They were asked to think and write about each prompt for 2 min_ The prompts differed by condition_ Depressive rumination prompts focused participants_ attention on thoughts that were emotion or self focused _e_g__ _why things turn out the way they do for you____ Distraction prompts focus participants_ attention on thoughts that were unrelated to the self _e_g__ _the layout of a mall you have been to____ Participants_ written statements were later coded by two independent raters who were blind to group and condition_ Rumination score ratings_ which were based on Hilt and Pollak _2013__ were made on a 5_point Likert scale ranging from 1 _Not at all ruminating_ to 5 _Completely ruminating__ ICC _ _84_\n\n2_4_ Measures\n2_4_1_ Sadness ratings\nSelf_reported sadness was assessed at 10 points_ upon entering the lab_ following a 5_min nature video_ during the forced_failure paradigm_ after the forced_failure paradigm_ immediately after the ER induction_ and five times during the nature video_ Participants utilized an 11_point Likert_scale ranging from 0 _not at all_ to 10 _very much__ To test the specific effects of the forced_failure and ER_induction_ we focused our analyses on assessments made following the nature video_ during the forced_failure paradigm_ and immediately after the ER induction_ The general pattern of findings does not differ based on whether all 10 samples are used_ with the three_way time by group by condition interaction remaining significant at Order 4_ F_1_ 91_ _ 5_85_ p _ _02_ _2 _ _06_\n\n2_4_2_ Questionnaires\nParticipants completed the Beck Depression Inventory_II _BDI_ Beck_ Steer_ _ Brown_ 1996__ a 21_item measure assessing depressive symptom severity __ _ _97__ Additionally_ participants completed the Ruminative Responses Scale of the Response Style Questionnaire _RRS_ Nolen_Hoeksema _ Morrow_ 1991__ a 22_item self_report questionnaire assessing individual differences in the tendency to ruminate when sad __ _ _99__\n\n2_5_ Cortisol collection and assay\nCortisol was extracted from saliva collected using salivette swabs _Sarstedt_ Numbrecht_ Germany__ Samples were stored at _20 _C until shipped to a laboratory for cortisol assay_ Samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min to produce a clear supernatant of low viscosity_ Using a commercially available immunoassay with chemiluminescence detection_ 50 _L were removed for cortisol analysis_ The lower detection limit of this assay was 0_43 nmol_L_ Intra_ and interassay coefficients of variation were below 8_ for low _3 nmol_L_ and high _25 nmol_L_ cortisol levels_\n\n2_6_ Procedure\nThe experiment was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Miami_ and all experiments were performed in accordance with ascribed guidelines and regulations_ In_person SCIDs were conducted by trained interviewers_ Participants who met inclusion and exclusion criteria were invited to return for the main study session_ We gave participants verbal and written instructions to refrain from eating_ drinking other than water_ using nicotine_ brushing their teeth_ and exercising for 2 h prior to the main study session_\n\nThe main study session was scheduled between 12 pm and 6 pm to minimize the effects of diurnal fluctuation in cortisol levels_ The session consisted of a 5_min nature video_ 30_min forced_failure paradigm_ 16_min ER induction_ and 35_min post_ER period_ During the post_ER period participants watched a nature video_ Timing of saliva samples was selected to identify changes in cortisol levels as a result of the ER manipulation_ Participants provided 11 cortisol samples_ immediately upon entering the lab _enter lab__ after the 5_min nature video_ in the middle of the forced failure induction_ at the end of the forced_failure period _30 min after failure onset_ post_failure__ in the middle of the ER induction_ at the end of the ER induction and every 7 min thereafter _post_ER 1_6__ Lastly_ participants completed the questionnaires_ Due to missing data or duplicate information_ samples 2_ 3_ and 5 were not included in the final analyses_\n\n2_7_ Statistical analyses\nDemographic data_ affect ratings_ and baseline differences between diagnostic group _MDD_ CTL_ and ER condition _rumination_ distraction_ were examined in SPSS 20_0 _SPSS Inc__ USA_ using analyses of variance _ANOVAs_ and chi_square tests_ Cortisol data were analyzed using multilevel modeling_ a series of growth models were conducted with hierarchical linear modeling software _HLM__ Version 6_01 _Raudenbush_ Bryk_ _ Congdon_ 2004__ Multilevel modeling is ideal for analyzing nested data_ Multilevel growth models allow researchers to partition the variance into two levels_ Level 1 _within individual_ represents intraindividual variability in scores at different measurement occasions_ and Level 2 _between individuals_ represents the variability between individuals_ scores_ HLM was specifically selected because it allows for the examination of variably spaced measurement occasions or observations that are unevenly spaced over time _Hruschka_ Kohrt_ _ Worthman_ 2005__ In our models_ the exact time of cortisol collection was allowed to vary by individual_ thereby providing a more precise estimation of time for each participant _Singer _ Willet_ 2003__ Diagnostic group_ ER condition_ and group _ condition were examined as predictors at Level 2_\n\n3_ Results\n3_1_ Participant characteristics\nParticipant characteristics are presented in Table 1_ There were no significant differences in age

study is the first to examine the effect of a depressive rumination versus distraction manipulation on salivary cortisol in clinically depressed and healthy control participants_ Results showed that the ER manipulation affected the trajectory of depressed participants_ cortisol levels_ Prior to the ER induction_ cortisol production did not differ by group or condition_ Following the ER induction_ however_ cortisol decline differed by group and condition_ MDDs in the rumination condition exhibited less cortisol decline compared to MDDs in the distraction condition and compared to CTLs in either ER condition_ In fact_ cortisol levels significantly declined for MDDs in the distraction condition_ CTLs in the depressive rumination condition_ and CTLs in the distraction condition_ whereas cortisol levels did not significantly decline for MDDs in the depressive rumination condition_\n\nAlthough authors have posited that forms of repetitive thought_ such as stressor_focused rumination_ change salivary cortisol secretion _Brosschot et al__ 2006_ Watkins_ 2008__ the effects of depressive rumination on salivary cortisol had never been experimentally investigated in a clinically depressed sample_ The majority of past research linking rumination and cortisol has been correlational _e_g__ Zoccola_ Dickerson_ _ Zaldivar_ 2008__ making it difficult to determine whether rumination leads to higher cortisol levels or whether higher cortisol levels lead to rumination_ This study demonstrates_ for the first time_ that experimentally induced depressive rumination alters cortisol decline in MDD_ Our findings are in line with an experimental study using a non_clinical sample_ in which undergraduates were exposed to a sad mood induction and then randomly assigned to ruminate on their sad mood_ distract themselves from it_ or mindfully self_focus _e_g__ Kuehner et al__ 2009__ Similar to results from the current study_ participants reporting high depression symptoms who were assigned to the depressive rumination condition showed less cortisol decline_ Such findings lend support to perseverative cognition models _Brosschot et al__ 2006_ Watkins_ 2008__ which suggest that repetitive thought processes _ such as depressive rumination _ have consequences for both emotional and physical wellbeing_\n\nResults from the current study advance our understanding of MDD in several ways_ For one_ results have direct relevance for the stress sensitization_kindling model of depression _Hammen_ 2005_ Post_ 1992__ This model posits that neurobiological changes during depressive episodes lead to increasing interdependence between negative events and depression_ Past research indicates that such neurobiological change can come from chronic cortisol activation_ which increases atrophy of brain regions such as the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus_ and in turn hinders one_s ability to regulate emotional responses to negative events _Gold et al__ 2002_ McEwen_ 1998__ With this in mind_ our findings suggest that depressive rumination increases the chance that depressed individuals will experience neurobiological changes that sensitize them to future negative events_ thereby increasing their chance of experiencing recurrent depressive episodes_\n\nIn addition_ knowledge elucidated from this study has important implications for our understanding of health and disease in MDD_ A diagnosis of depression places individuals at increased risk for poor health outcomes_ including faster progression of illness_ immunosuppression_ and increased risk of cardiac events _e_g__ Kiecolt_Glaser_ McGuire_ Robles_ _ Glaser_ 2002__ Past research has demonstrated that chronic cortisol hypersecretion has substantial effects on cardiovascular health and immune functioning _McEwen_ 1998_ McEwen_ 2008__ Results from the current study suggest that depressive rumination may contribute to the cortisol hypersecretion that places depressed individuals at increased risk for health difficulties_ This possibility has important implications for clinical interventions for individuals with MDD and comorbid health conditions_ For example_ interventions that target depressive rumination may be an important addition to behavioral medicine_\n\nInterestingly_ healthy controls in the current study did not differ in their cortisol decline based on whether they were assigned to ruminate or distract_ Although unexpected_ this is in line with a study by Young and Nolen_Hoeksema _2001__ in which high and low trait ruminators did not differ in their cortisol response to stress_ The authors attributed their null results to a lack of depressive rumination in their non_clinical sample_ as determined by a retrospective analysis of participants_ thought samples_ A similar explanation might apply to the current study given that our manipulation check suggested that the depressive rumination induction was less effective for CTLs than MDDs_ However_ there is evidence supporting the effectiveness of our emotion regulation induction in both the CTL and MDD groups_ In both groups_ participants exhibited more rumination when in the depressive rumination compared to distraction condition_ In addition_ depressive rumination prolonged self_reported sadness in both the CTL and MDD group_ Thus_ another explanation for our findings might be considered_ It is possible that depressive rumination did not affect CTLs_ cortisol levels due to effective functioning of their HPA axis_ An important component of HPA axis functioning is the ability to down_regulate cortisol production when optimal cortisol levels have been reached_ This is accomplished via negative feedback loops_ receptors on the hypothalamus_ pituitary_ and hippocampus identify elevated levels of cortisol and signal the HPA axis to decrease cortisol production _McEwen_ 2006__ The chronic cortisol elevation often associated with MDD can damage the sensitivity of glucocorticoid receptors_ and thus contribute to difficulty down regulating cortisol production _Burke et al__ 2005_ McEwen_ 2008__ In contrast_ healthy functioning of negative feedback loops helps avoid excess cortisol production and may have protected CTLs against the effects of depressive rumination_ Although additional research is needed to explore this possibility_ it is in line with results from Kuehner et al_ _2009_ showing that participants who reported low depressive symptoms did not differ in their cortisol decline based on whether they were in the depressive rumination or distraction condition_\n\nSeveral limitations of the current study should be mentioned_ For one_ many participants with depression also met criteria for a comorbid psychiatric diagnosis_ However_ participants were randomly assigned to either the rumination or distraction condition and there were no systematic differences between the two conditions_ Second_ several participants were taking medications_ Although the sample size in the current study prevented us from examining the effects of specific medication classes on change in cortisol_ the percent of individuals on medication did not significantly differ between the rumination and distraction conditions in either group_ In addition_ the current study did not include an assessment of baseline cortisol_ Given that the first cortisol sample was taken almost immediately after participants arrived in the laboratory and there is typically a 10_20 min lag in cortisol response _Dickerson and Kemeny_ 2004__ there would not have been enough time for cortisol levels to reach baseline_ Given that the goal of the current study was to examine change in cortisol as a result of the ER induction_ we structured the study procedure to maximize the amount of time and number of cortisol samples after the ER induction_ As a result_ however_ we are unable to answer questions related to baseline cortisol or changes from baseline in this sample_ The lack of baseline cortisol sample may explain why we did not see a change in cortisol from when participants entered the laboratory to the end of the forced failure induction_ Any potential decline in cortisol due to participants_ habituating to the laboratory may have been offset by potential increases in cortisol due to the forced failure induction_ Future research might examine this question more closely_\n\nDespite these limitations_ the current study provides important information about how rumination affects cortisol production in MDD_ In doing so_ this study advances integrated emotional_cognitive_biological models of MDD _Hammen_ 2005_ Post_ 1992_ Watkins_ 2008__ Moreover_ keeping in mind the consequences of prolonged cortisol levels on cardiovascular health and immune functioning _McEwen_ 1998__ rumination may be a key factor that places depressed individuals at increased risk for poor health outcomes_ such as increased risk of a cardiac event and faster progression of illness_ Thus_ identifying rumination as a mechanism underlying excess cortisol production in MDD may have important implications for understanding not only the maintenance and recurrence of depressive episodes but also the comorbid physical health conditions associated with depression _see Watkins_ 2008_ for a review__",
